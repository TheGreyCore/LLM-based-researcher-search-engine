2024,Kaarel Sikk,Framing settlement systems as spatial adaptive systems,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2024.110652,Complex adaptive systems | Complexity | Locational modelling | Residential location choice | Settlement systems | Social-ecological systems,," Theoretical developments are needed to interpret the increasing amount of large-scale spatial data about past settlements. So far, settlement patterns have mostly been considered as passive imprints of past human activities and most theories are limited to ecological processes. Locational and spatial interactions have scarcely been included as long-term driving forces of settlement systems but hold promise to explain large-scale patterns. This paper proposes a conceptual model for long-term spatial adaptive settlement systems based on the complex adaptive systems framework and both spatial and cross-scale interactions. The goal of the model is to find new ways of interpreting archaeological location data and understand settlement systems as emerging from micro-choices of population units interacting in space. The conceptualisation is carried out on a level that it can be used to bridge hunter-gatherer and urban theories. We first describe settlement patterns based on concepts from archaeological locational studies and social-ecological systems. Second, we identify the abstract spatial and aspatial entities of the system and describe the potential relations between them. Using knowledge from previous research, we then map both empirically observable and abstract system entities and predict links between them in order to come up with an overarching conceptual framework. The system is based on residential choice mechanisms and exposes several cross-scale feedback loops between the micro-level choices and the settlement system emerging at the meso-level. We finally argue that the proposed adaptive settlement system framework has the potential to bring new insights into long-term processes, especially through dynamic spatial simulation, and at the same time, provides an interpretational framework for archaeological records and empirical spatial analysis. Examples of its applications in archaeological research are introduced."

The current article provides an overview of the latest developments in the applications of the 5G mobile network standard in CAM and is specifically focused on analyzing existing and potential applications within European T&L corridors and subsequent markets. A focused marketplace analysis is conducteFd, highlighting the demands of commercialization clusters within European cross-border markets, as well as an analysis of how some of these demands can supplement the deployment of 5G products and services in the coming years. With the aim of providing a macro-level description of the landscape of 5G applications in CAM, the authors further discuss and classify the markets' influencing factors according to the PESTEL framework, which is further enhanced to include the recent impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine. The findings display that while 5G is a crucial underlying technology for the establishment of CAM, several factors, such as international security, political coordination at the EU level, and common technological standards across EU member states, will have a central role in the successful deployment of its applications."

The problem is actually in Estonia also, first of all in the sector of heat and power production which based mainly on the combustion of local solid fossil fuel: Estonian oil shale (OS) resulting in the formation of ~5&6 million tons of OS ashes annually. The thermooxidative decomposition of OS samples from different deposits and estimation of the possibilities of utilization of OS ashes formed at both: pulverized firing (PF) and circulating fluidized bed combustion (CFBC) of Estonian OS were studied. The thermal analysis combined with evolved gas analysis (EGA) methods like Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and mass-spectroscopy (MS) was exploited. It was established that the differences in the thermal behaviour of different OS samples are caused by the differences in the chemical matrix of organic matter, chemical and mineralogical composition of the inorganic part of OS, and morphology of samples. It was also found that moderate grinding of OS ashes with simultaneous moderate water treatment notably improved the SO2binding efficiency of cyclone ash, and that the strength and leachability characteristics of granulated OS ashes strongly depend on the post-granulation treatment conditions allowing to increase the soil neutralizing ability of the granulated products. This overview was based on our investigations carried out during the last fifteen years."
2022,Emlyn David Qivitoq Witt,Approaches to Strengthen the Social Cohesion between Displaced and Host Communities,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/14/6/3413/htm,https://doi.org/10.3390/su14063413,,,"A cohesive society is not only characterised by the availability of basic services and facilities, but also promotes economic equality and inclusion, democracy, and social solidarity. Forced displacement due to disasters and conflict constantly disrupt the path to a sustainable and cohesive society. Displaced communities often struggle with a lack of access to livelihood and a lack of financial independence and social and family stability. With these challenges, a lack of provision of basic services and facilities will create a competition for housing, health, and education between the displaced and host communities. Additionally, the economic competition for jobs and the role of international aid in terms of fairness create social tension between the displaced and the host. Likewise, multiple aspects weaken the social cohesion between displaced and host communities. Within this context, we investigated approaches to enhance social cohesion following disaster-induced and conflict-induced displacement. With the identification of this research need, the research team of the project titled REGARD (REbuild-inG AfteR Displacement) conducted 47 in-depth interviews in four partner countries (U.K., Sweden, Estonia, and Sri Lanka) with community representatives, social support networks, agency networks, officials, etc. Moreover, focus group discussions were conducted with community members in Sri Lanka. The collected data were analysed through a qualitative data analysis procedure. The findings present eight approaches to strengthen the social cohesion between displaced and host communities. These eight approaches include the adequate provision of basic services and facilities without limiting the capacity of the host, support services aimed at local integration, economic integration between the displaced and host, and social cohesion through the built environment."

Viscosity and conductivity values are reported for various DMOHC and diethyl-2,5- dioxahexane carboxylate (DEOHC) blends with dimethyl carbonate (DMC) and diethyl carbonate (DEC). Charge-discharge cycling data are reported for LiFePO4/graphite (LFP), Li[Ni0.5Mn0.3Co0.2]O2/graphite (NMC3.8 V, balanced for 3.8 V cut-off), Li[Ni0.6Mn0.4Co00]O2/graphite (NMC640, balanced for 4.1 V cut-off) and Li[Ni0.83Mn0.06Co0.11]O2/graphite (Ni83, balanced for 4.06 V cut-off) pouch cells at 70 ¬∞C and 85 ¬∞C. Pouch cells with DMOHC electrolyte have extraordinarily long lifetimes at 70 ¬∞C and 85 ¬∞C Pouch cells containing DMOHC-based electrolytes produce little to no gas compared to traditional ethylene carbonate (EC) based electrolytes. Cells taken apart after testing showed uniform negative electrode lithiation and no differences in the cell components were observed when using DMOHC electrolytes compared to EC. Lastly, micro X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy analysis was performed to probe the degree of transition metal deposition on negative electrodes of cycled cells. Very low levels of transition metals were found on the negative electrode even for cells tested at 85 ¬∞C. DMOHC is a co-solvent that can enable Li-ion batteries with exceptional high temperature lifetimes."

The 71 participants were interviewed and underwent the Mediterranean Islands study food frequency questionnaire (MEDIS-FFQ) and the international physical activity questionnaire (IPAQ). The frequency of social contacts was daily for 77.9% of participants, weekly for 16.1%, and monthly for 5.9%. Most participants (90.0%) believed in God, and 81.4% took part in religious events. A total of 62.0% attended Panigiria festivals. Access to primary health care was considered difficult in the past for 66.2% of participants, while 22.1% felt that it remained difficult at the time of the survey. The level of adherence to the Mediterranean diet was 62.7% (61.6% in women and 64.0% in men). Physical activity levels were moderate or high for 71.8% of participants (59.5% of women and 85.3% of men). In conclusion, the participants had a very high level of family solidarity, social interaction and physical activity. The results concerning the Mediterranean diet are less convincing. It would be interesting to study the impact of these factors on the longevity of the oldest old aged people living in Ikaria."

To address this challenge, this study investigates the efficacy of the BIG GAME project methodology, a cooperative story-driven digital game approach designed to engage secondary students in collaborative environmental problem-solving. Implemented across Romania, Italy, Estonia, and Finland, this six-month study employed a mixed-methods design involving 62 teachers and 239 students in ten distinct game missions focused on environmental challenges. The quantitative results indicated significant improvements in students' transversal skills (teamwork, communication, and critical thinking), as reported by over 75% of teachers. The qualitative data emphasised the value of structured peer review in developing students' reflective practices. This research underscores the importance of teacher facilitation in game-based learning and problem-based simulations and highlights the potential of such methodologies to boost student engagement and environmental awareness. These findings suggest that the BIG GAME project approach could be a valuable tool for revitalising STEM education and cultivating future-ready citizens."

This is similar to establishing a simulation using a robot operating system (ROS) or other industrial-owned platforms to simulate robot operations and sending the details to the robot controller. In this paper, we propose a Digital Twin model that assists in the online/remote programming of a robotic cell by creating a 3D digital environment of a real-world configuration. Our Digital Twin model consists of two components, (1) a physical model: FANUC robot (M-10iA/12), and (2) a digital model: Unity (a gaming platform) that comes with specialized plugins for virtual and augmented reality devices. One of the main challenges in the existing approach of robot programming is writing and modifying code for a robot trajectory that is eased in our framework using a Digital Twin. Using a Digital Twin setup along with Virtual Reality, we observe the trajectory replication between digital and physical robots. The simulation analysis provided a latency of approximately 40 ms with an error range of √¢ÀÜ‚Äô0.28 to 0.28√¢ÀÜÀúacross the robot joint movements in a simulation environment and √¢ÀÜ‚Äô0.3 to 0.3√¢ÀÜÀúacross the actual robot joint movements.

We highlight that the conservation concept of focal species (selected species sensitive to a set of anthropogenic threats to their habitat) links multiple issues of ecological sustainability, and their habitat models can provide a practical tool for solving these issues. A review of the literature shows that most spatial modeling of focal species focuses on vertebrates, lacks the aspect of aquatic and soil habitats, and has been slow in the uptake by actual management planning. We elaborate on a deductive modeling approach that first generalizes the main influential dimensions of habitat change (threats), which are then parameterized as habitat quality estimates for focal species. If built on theoretical understanding and properly scaled, the maps produced with such models can cost-effectively describe the dynamics of ecological qualities across forest landscapes, help set conservation priorities, and reflect on management plans and practices. The models also serve as ecological hypotheses on biodiversity and landscape function. We illustrate this approach based on recent additions to the forest reserve network in Estonia, which addressed the insufficient protection of productive forest types. For this purpose, mostly former production forests that may require restoration were set aside. We distinguished seven major habitat dimensions and their representative taxa in these forests and depicted each dimension as a practical stand-scale decision tree of habitat quality. The model outcomes implied that popular stand-structural targets of active forest restoration would recover passively in reasonable time in these areas, while a critically degraded condition (loss of old trees of characteristic species) required management beyond reserve borders. Another hidden issue revealed was that only a few stands of consistently low habitat quality concentrated in the landscape to allow cost-efficient restoration planning. We conclude that useful habitat models for sustainable forest management have to balance single-species realism with stakeholder expectations of meaningful targets and scales. Addressing such social aspects through the focal species concept could accelerate the adoption of biodiversity distribution modeling in forestry."

However, longitudinal data regarding the associations of body fatness, physical fitness, and cognition are relatively scarce and mixed. The purpose of this longitudinal study was to investigate whether body fatness, cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), and muscular fitness (MF) in preschool are associated with cognitive skills in the first grade of school. A total of 133 South Estonian children whose age was 6&7 years were recruited from 13 kindergartens and again at 7&8 years after they had entered school. Body fat percentage (BF%), CRF, MF as the mean of z-scores of relative upper-limb strength, standing long jump results, and cognitive skills (verbal, conceptual, and perceptual) were studied. There were no associations between BF% and CRF in preschool with perceptual, conceptual, or verbal skills in school in boys and girls. In boys, a higher MF in preschool was associated with higher verbal skills (√é¬≤ = 0.293,p= 0.021) in school after adjustment for confounders. Cognitive skills at baseline seemed to be frequently associated with cognitive performance in school. In conclusion, higher MF in preschool was associated with better verbal skills in the first grade of school in boys but not in girls. Body fatness and cardiorespiratory fitness in preschool were not associated with cognitive skills in school."

This method uses input data from tide gauge and altimetry observations. The reconstruction is based on sea level empirical orthogonal function (EOF) modes, calculated as spatiotemporal statistics from daily model reanalysis results available from the Copernicus Marine Service for the 1993&2021 period. In the semi-enclosed, tideless Baltic Sea, the four leading EOF modes cover 99% of the sea level variance. Several experiments with different combinations of input data were carried out. This method was validated against coastal tide gauges and altimetry data. The best reconstruction was obtained when both the tide gauges and altimetry data were used as inputs. An assessment of the centered root-mean-square difference (cRMSD) of the reconstruction versus the tide gauges revealed a value of 0.05 m, and a result of 0.10 m was revealed versus altimetry. The average coefficient of determination (R2) was determined to be 0.93 for the tide gauges and 0.82 for the altimetry data. In the cases where only one type of input data was used, the reconstruction worsened with respect to other data sources. The reconstruction method demonstrated its usefulness for the reconstruction of coastal sea levels in unsampled locations and the calculation of changes in sea volume."

This paper presents a methodology and the results of analysis of choices of realizable sets of timber frame prefabricated insulation elements for major renovation of apartment buildings. Numerous combinations of elements with different characteristics were analyzed by applying measurements, interviews, and building performance simulation software, and thereupon their performance, installation eligibility, and concurrent cost levels were compared. Mineral wool board with a special wind barrier facing was found to be the best material as a wind barrier from the perspective of hygrothermal performance. An air and vapor barrier should have sufficient vapor permeability to allow dry-out of constructional moisture. It is possible to renovate apartment buildings to meet the nZEB energy performance requirements and their moisture safety can be guaranteed without paying high relative difference cost. Calculations showed that the global cost was lower for solutions with some mold growth risk. Great care is needed when decreasing costs without simultaneous hygrothermal analyses. The facade cladding was found to have the highest influence on the initial cost of the prefabricated insulation element."

In 1992, when concerns arose regarding the impact of driftnets on dolphin and seabird populations, the Commission of the European Communities decided to prohibit √¢‚Ç¨≈ìany vessel from carrying on board or engaging in fishing activities with one or more driftnets whose individual or cumulative length exceeds 2.5 kilometers√¢‚Ç¨¬ù (OJEC, 1992). This ban met a lot of resistance from the fishers and led to unintended consequences. Once driftnets were banned, fishing activity was shifted offshore by long-lining, where other species such as albatrosses and petrels started to be affected by bycatch (Euzen et√Ç¬†al., 2017). Another European regulation was implemented in 1997 to ban the use of driftnets for the capture of certain migratory fishes such as albacore (Thunnus alalunga) and bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) starting from 2002 (OJEC, 1997). It was not until 2011 that French law transposed the European driftnet regulations (JORF, 2011a). Another ministerial order was issued in 2011, to determine the list of marine mammals protected on the national territory and the modalities of their protection (JORF, 2011b). In 2019, a bycatch reporting requirement for fishers was introduced, requiring ship captains to report protected marine mammal specimens caught accidentally in fishing gear (JORF, 2018). The information provided by fishers is intended to advance research into the understanding and characterization of incidental catches, with the aim of preventing them. This declaration can be made through a digital declaration for vessels of more than 12 meters equipped with an electronic fishing logbook, while smaller vessels can use fishing paper's sheets (Ministry of Agriculture, 2022). Finally, from 26 December 2019, fishers have the obligation to equip pelagic trawls with acoustic deterrent devices, also called pingers, in the Bay of Biscay (JORF, 2019)."

The most distinguished of these are the Citizen Science Association (ostensibly a US-based association, but offering global membership), the European Citizen Science Association, and the Australian Citizen Science Association. Each of these relatively new associations have highlighted education and learning as critical issues for citizen science as an emerging professional field (Storksdieck et al., 2016;Roche and Davis, 2017a). Citizen science has the capacity to √¢‚Ç¨≈ìdevelop connections between students' everyday lives and science so that they will have tangible reasons for continuing with the lifelong learning of science√¢‚Ç¨¬ù (Jenkins, 2011, p. 501). It can function as a means of engaging the public with science on the scale of individual experiments, creating a unique position of combining participation, monitoring, and social change (Doyle et al., 2019;Dawson et al., 2020). Citizen science also offers a route by which the tenets of responsible research and innovation (Owen et al., 2012) may be fulfilled, particularly by facilitating lesser-heard communities in having their voices heard in relation to scientific policy-making and governance. This is now of more importance than ever, as researchers and academic experts find society's trust in their authority diminished (Roche and Davis, 2017b), while the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated the acute need for public trust to be strengthened (Henderson et al., 2020). Indeed, citizen science might offer a more pressing model for science in a post-pandemic world (Provenzi and Barello, 2020). Despite its growing importance, citizen science is rarely considered in terms of science education research (Kelemen-Finan et al., 2018). For the purposes of this paper, the term √¢‚Ç¨≈ìscience√¢‚Ç¨¬ù is taken to encompass systematic and evidence-based investigations in the pursuit of new knowledge, while the term √¢‚Ç¨≈ìeducation√¢‚Ç¨¬ù is considered to be the acquisition of knowledge through learning. Learning can be self-directed, but often relies on the guidance of a teacher. The learning can take place in either formal or informal environments and the methods of teaching, or pedagogy, can be as varied as the settings themselves. While these definitions are not all-inclusive, they provide a starting point where science, education, and learning can be considered in relation to the emerging challenges and opportunities stemming from citizen science."

One notable tool is internet voting (i-voting) since it is able to empower people with a more direct and influential voice in local policy making. Thereby, this paper suggests some concepts and models of open government and i-voting, provides several examples, outlines preconditions, discusses risks, and offers recommendations for introducing i-voting and enhancing open government.

However, the continuous control set model predictive control, required for precise torque stabilization and predictable power converter behavior, needs sufficient computation resources, thus limiting its practical implementation. The proposed model predictive control strategy utilizes offline processing of the magnetization surface of the switched reluctance motor. This helps to obtain precalculated current references for each torque command and rotor angular position in the offline mode. In online mode, the model predictive control strategy implements the current commands using the magnetization surface for fast evaluation of the required voltage command for the power converter. The proposed strategy needs only two lookup table operations requiring very small computation time, making instant execution of the whole control system possible and thereby minimizing the control delay. The proposed solution was examined using a simulation model, which showed precise and rapid torque stabilization below rated speed."

Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) are a powerful tool when it comes to supporting farm-scale phenotyping trials. In this study, we explored the variation of the red clover-grass mixture dry matter (DM) yields between temporal periods (one- and two-year cultivated), farming operations [soil tillage methods (STM), cultivation methods (CM), manure application (MA)] using three machine learning (ML) techniques [random forest regression (RFR), support vector regression (SVR), and artificial neural network (ANN)] and six multispectral vegetation indices (VIs) to predict DM yields. The ML evaluation results showed the best performance for ANN in the 11-day before harvest category (R2= 0.90, NRMSE = 0.12), followed by RFR (R2= 0.90 NRMSE = 0.15), and SVR (R2= 0.86, NRMSE = 0.16), which was furthermore supported by the leave-one-out cross-validation pre-analysis. In terms of VI performance, green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI), green difference vegetation index (GDVI), as well as modified simple ratio (MSR) performed better as predictors in ANN and RFR. However, the prediction ability of models was being influenced by farming operations. The stratified sampling, based on STM, had a better model performance than CM and MA. It is proposed that drone data collection was suggested to be optimum in this study, closer to the harvest date, but not later than the ageing stage."

An asymmetric 2-electrode ultracapacitor containing ox-red-CDC as the anode and pristine CDC as the cathode demonstrated an excellent cycle life.

more responsibility and autonomy for their learning, i.e., student empowerment. The bias for the need
for the Swedish language is that more and more Scandinavian businesses are establishing businesses

Sohlberg [1] has commented that the fundamental rights are individual rights, independent of the identity of the beneficiary. However, the ability of a person to cope with his/her life independently is, for Europe, very important. The utilized methodology has been the collective case study according to Mills [2]. I followed the information-oriented selection: the cases of maximum variation by size and location [3]. Triangulation has been used as a procedure for acquiring data. Further analysis was conducted by using the complementary configurations according to Ragin [4]. According to the research findings, there has been tension between the fundamental rights of citizenship and social work practice. Analysed the availability, there could find the several risk groups, who are legally excluded from the local social work (welfare) system (long-term unemployed, person who cares for one's relatives). The responsibility for the care of a person during his or her long-term care, illness, or profound disability lies solely on the family. In the dominant practice, the local government supports only single (older) people, the decision-makers are according to ‚ÄúEstonian Family Law Act‚Äù [5], which gives the order of care to families first. This is the basis for giving and receiving social assistance and providing the social services such as home care services or institutional care services. Social work focuses on the needs of people, with a primary nature requiring that they be dealt with as part of mandatory laws. The actual challenge of Estonian public discussion should be how to ensure the fundamental right of every citizen to receive government support from a local government in the case of the need and in addition to the list of laws compulsory for all."

A heap is a ternary operation exemplified by a group with the operation $(x,y,z) \mapsto xy^{-1}z$, that is ternary self-distributive. Hopf algebras can be endowed with the algebra version of the heap operation. Using this, we construct braided Frobenius algebras from a class of certain Hopf algebras that admit integrals and cointegrals. For these Hopf algebras we show that the heap operation induces a braiding, by means of a Yang-Baxter operator on the tensor product, which satisfies the required compatibility conditions. Diagrammatic methods are employed for proving commutativity between the braiding and Frobenius operations."

In this work we extend the original bimetric theory to its bimetric-affine counterpart, in which the two connections, associated with the Ricci scalars, are treated as independent variables. We examine in detail the case of an additional quadratic in the Ricci scalar curvature term $\mathcal{R}^2(g,\Gamma)$ and we find that this theory is free of ghosts for a wide range of the interaction parameters, not excluding the possibility of a Dark Matter interpretation of the massive spin-2 particle."

satellites: detection & Ephemerides","Context: Few exoplanets around hot stars with radiative envelopes have been discovered, although new observations from the TESS mission are improving this. Stars with radiative envelopes have little mixing at their surface, and thus their surface abundances provide a sensitive test case for a variety of processes including potentially star-planet interactions. Atomic diffusion is particularly important in these envelopes, producing chemically peculiar objects such as Am and HgMn stars. Aims: An exoplanet candidate around the B6 star HD 235349 was identified by TESS. Here we determine the nature of this transiting object and identify possible chemical peculiarities in the star. Methods: HD 235349 was observed using the long-slit spectrograph at Tartu Observatory, as well as photometrically by the TESS mission. The spectra were modeled to determine stellar parameters and chemical abundances. The photometric light curve was then analyzed in the context of the stellar parameters to determine properties of the transiting object. Results: We find the transiting object is a low-mass stellar companion, not a planet. However, the primary of this eclipsing binary is a rare type of chemically peculiar star. A strong overabundance of P is found with overabundances of Ne and Nd, and mild overabundances of Ti and Mn, while He is mildly underabundant. There is also clear evidence for vertical stratification of P in the atmosphere of the star. The lack of Hg and weak Mn overabundance suggests that this is not a typical HgMn star. It may be in the class of helium-weak phosphorus-gallium (He-weak PGa) stars, or an intermediate between these two classes. Conclusions: We show that HD 235349 is a rare type of chemically peculiar star (He-weak PGa) in an eclipsing binary system with a low-mass stellar companion. This appears to be the first He-weak PGa star discovered in an eclipsing binary."

Quite generically it also predicts the speed of gravitational waves $c_{GW}$ to be different from the speed of light. This fact alone led some authors to exclude such models in view of the new tight observational constraints on $c_{GW}$. However, the behaviour of $c_{GW}$ depends on the choice of the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) coupling function. It is possible to construct models where $c_{GW}$ is always equal to the speed of light. More generally, $c_{GW}$ is a time dependent function with instances where both speeds coincide. Nevertheless, we observe that the bound on $c_{GW}$ excludes scenarios where the GB term directly affects the expansion of the Universe, even if the constraint on the variation of the coupling function does not appear to be strong. We perform the dynamical systems analysis to see if the expansion of the Universe could be affected indirectly by modulating the behaviour of the scalar field, which modulates the GB coupling. It is shown that either the bounds on $c_{GW}$ are violated by many orders of magnitude, or it might be very difficult to find models that are consistent with other cosmological observations."

We study the profile of the equivalent effective metric theory, featuring an extra dynamical pseudoscalar degree of freedom, and show that it reduces to an effective single-field inflationary model. We analyze in detail the inflationary predictions and find that they fall within the latest observational bounds for a wide range of parameters, allowing for an increase in the tensor-to-scalar ratio.

However, the relatively recent observational constraints on the speed of gravitational waves $c_{\textrm{GW}}$ have resulted in many of those models being ruled out because they predict $c_{\textrm{GW}} \neq c$ generally. While these were formulated in the metric formalism of gravity, we put forward a new quintessence model with the scalar-Gauss-Bonnet action but in Weyl geometry, where the connection is not metric compatible. We find the fixed points of the dynamical system under some assumptions and determine their stability via linear analysis. The past evolution of the Universe can be reproduced correctly, but the late Universe constraints on $c_{\textrm{GW}}$ are grossly violated. Moreover, at these later stages tensor modes suffer from the gradient instabilities. We also consider the implications of imposing an additional constraint $c_{\textrm{GW}} = c$, but this does not lead to evolution that is consistent with cosmological observations"

The perturbation probability distribution is an analytical function of the integrated curvature power spectrum $\sigma_k^2$ and the second slow-roll parameter $\epsilon_2$. With a large $\epsilon_2$, stochastic effects can reduce the height of the curvature power spectrum required to form asteroid mass black holes from $10^{-2}$ to $10^{-3}$.

Multiple identical components are scheduled to run concurrently in order to handle unexpected failures and provide uninterrupted service to the end user, which introduces resource overhead problem for the cloud service provider. Furthermore such resource-intensive fault tolerant strategies bring extra monetary overhead to the cloud service provider and eventually to the cloud users. In order to address these issues, a novel fault tolerant strategy based on the significance level of each component is developed. The communication topology among the application components, their historical performance, failure rate, failure impact on other components, dependencies among them, etc., are used to rank those application components to further decide on the importance of one component over others. Based on the rank, a Markov Decision Process (MDP) model is presented to determine the number of replicas that varies from one component to another. A rigorous performance evaluation is carried out using some of the most common practically useful metrics such as, recovery time upon a fault, average number of components needed, number of parallel components successfully executed, etc., to quote a few, with similar component ranking and fault tolerant strategies. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm reduces the required number of virtual and physical machines by approximately 10% and 4.2%, respectively, compared to other similar algorithms."

Currently, the ExoClock network includes 280 participants with telescopes capable of observing 85\% of the currently known Ariel candidate targets. This work includes the results of $\sim$1600 observations obtained up to the 31st of December 2020 from the ExoClock network. These data in combination with $\sim$2350 mid-time values collected from the literature are used to update the ephemerides of 180 planets. The analysis shows that 40\% of the updated ephemerides will have an impact on future scheduling as either they have a significantly improved precision, or they have revealed biases in the old ephemerides. With the new observations, the observing coverage and rate for half of the planets in the sample has been doubled or more. Finally, from a population perspective, we identify that the differences in the 2028 predictions between the old and the new ephemerides have an STD that is double what is expected from gaussian uncertainties. These findings have implications for planning future observations, where we will need to account for drifts potentially greater than the prediction uncertainties.

In some regions of the parameter space, the Majoron - the pseudo-Goldstone of lepton number breaking - is a viable dark matter candidate. The bound on the Majoron decay rate implies a very large dilaton vacuum expectation value, which also results in a suppression of other dark matter couplings. Because of that, the observed dark matter relic abundance can only be matched via the freeze-in mechanism. The scalar field which gives mass to heavy neutrinos can play the role of the inflaton, resulting in a tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \lesssim 0.01$ for metric inflation and $r \lesssim 0.21$ for Palatini gravity."

This theory contains the Ricci-like and parity-odd Holst invariants together with non-minimal couplings between the PNGB and the above-mentioned invariants. The Palatini and Einstein-Cartan realizations of natural inflation are particular cases of our construction. Explicit models of this type featuring non-minimal couplings are shown to emerge from the microscopic dynamics of a QCD-like theory with an either sub-Planckian or trans-Planckian confining scale and that is renormalizable on Minkowski spacetime. Moreover, for these models, we find regions of the parameter space where the inflationary predictions agree with the most recent observations at the $2\sigma$ level. We find that in order to enter the $1\sigma$ region it is necessary (and sufficient) to have a finite value of the Barbero-Immirzi parameter and a sizable non-minimal coupling between the inflaton and the Holst invariant (with sign opposite to the Barbero-Immirzi parameter). Indeed, in this case the potential of the canonically normalized inflaton develops a plateau as shown analytically."

Using the $\Delta N$ formalism, we present the first stochastic calculation of the probability distribution $P(\mathcal{R})$ of the curvature perturbation during USR. We capture the non-linearity of the system, solving the coupled evolution of the coarse-grained background with random kicks from the short wavelength modes, simultaneously with the mode evolution around the stochastic background. This leads to a non-Markovian process from which we determine the highly non-Gaussian tail of $P(\mathcal{R})$. Studying the production of primordial black holes in a viable model, we find that stochastic effects during USR increase their abundance by a factor $\sim 10^5$ compared to the Gaussian approximation."

In order to identify the differences between the two formalisms analytically, we follow a perturbative approach in which the gravitational corrections are taken into consideration via a leading order expansion in the gravitational coupling constant. Our analysis shows that in the Palatini formalism, the well-known effect of gravity suppressing the vacuum decay probability, becomes milder in comparison with the metric case for any value of the nonminimal coupling $\xi$. Furthermore, we have found that in the Palatini formalism, the positivity of the gravitational corrections, which is a necessary requirement for the unitarity of the theory, entails the lower bound $\xi>-1/12$."

Our formalism does not introduce unphysical degrees of freedom, thus avoiding the potential inconsistencies that may appear in other field-theoretical descriptions of higher spin. Being a useful reformulation of the Weinberg's original idea, the proposed effective field theory allows for consistent computations of physical observables for general-spin particles, although it does not admit a Lagrangian description. As a specific realization, we explore the phenomenology of a general-spin singlet with $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric Higgs portal couplings, a setup which automatically arises for high spin, and show that higher spin particles with masses above $O(10)\,\mathrm{TeV}$ can be viable thermally-produced DM candidates. Most importantly, if the general-spin DM has purely parity-odd couplings, it naturally avoids all DM direct detection bounds, in which case its mass can lie below the electroweak scale. Our formalism reproduces the existing results for low-spin DM, and allows one to develop consistent higher-spin particle physics phenomenology for high- and low-energy experiments and cosmology."

We study several test models in relation to a Jordan frame defined by the common Higgs-inflation-like non-minimal coupling to gravity and consider two different formulations of gravity: metric and Palatini. We find that the difference is quite contained in case of a metric Jordan frame while can be quite remarkable in case of a Palatini Jordan frame. We also discuss a way to overcome the discrepancy by introducing a frame invariant physical distance and a consequently frame invariant number of $e$-folds.

In such scenarios, the initial CMB spectrum is created at large field values. Subsequently, the inflaton will cross one of the minima and will decelerate rapidly as it reaches the local maximum at the origin, either falling back or crossing it. During this final phase, a significant peak in the curvature power spectrum can be generated. Our analysis reveals that this class of models produces more pronounced peaks than the more commonly studied quasi-inflection point scenarios with less tuning for the model parameters. Finally, we construct an explicit theoretically motivated inflationary scenario that is consistent with the latest CMB observations and capable of generating sufficiently large curvature perturbations for primordial black holes."

In such scenarios, even a small radiation abundance, produced for instance by instantaneous preheating effects, will eventually dominate the total energy density of the Universe without the need for a complete inflaton decay. For the sake of concreteness, we focus in non-oscillatory (NO) quintessential inflation models, albeit our treatment is rather general and can be extended to other scenarios. The high temperature of the initial thermal bath together with the absence of subsequent entropy injections into the Standard Model plasma translates into a highly-effective UV DM freeze-in. In particular, we find that, during kination, an enhancement in the DM abundance is generically obtained for any production cross-section not-decreasing with temperature."

We determined filaments in the supercluster to analyse the connectivity of clusters. We compared the mass distribution in the CB with predictions from the spherical collapse model and analysed the acceleration field in the CB. We found that at a radius $R_{\mathrm{30}}$ around clusters in the CB (A2065, A2061, A2089, and Gr2064) (corresponding to the density contrast $\Delta\rho \approx 30$), the galaxy distribution shows a minimum. The $R_{30}$ values for individual clusters lie in the range of $3 - 6$ $h^{-1}$ Mpc. The radii of the clusters (splashback radii) lie in the range of $R_{\mathrm{cl}} \approx 2 - 3$ $R_{\mathrm{vir}}$. The projected phase space diagrams and the comparison with the spherical collapse model suggest that $R_{\mathrm{30}}$ regions have passed turnaround and are collapsing. Galaxy content in clusters varies strongly. The cluster A2061 has the highest fraction of galaxies with old stellar populations, and A2065 has the highest fraction of galaxies with young stellar populations. The number of long filaments near clusters vary from one at A2089 to five at A2061. During the future evolution, the clusters in the main part of the CB may merge and form one of the largest bound systems in the nearby Universe. Another part of the CB, with the cluster Gr2064, will form a separate system. The structures with a current density contrast $\Delta\rho \approx 30$ have passed turnaround and started to collapse at redshifts $z \approx 0.3 - 0.4$. The comparison of the number and properties of the most massive collapsing supercluster cores from observations and simulations may serve as a test for cosmological models."

As a result, we can analytically describe UCOs with a mass-to-radius ratio higher than for a Schwarzschild black hole. The corresponding spacetime is regular everywhere. We show that the Ostrogradsky instabilities can be avoided and discuss the relation with the Higgs vacuum metastability. Due to the lack of a horizon, light UCOs do not evaporate. Therefore, they may play the role of dark matter. We briefly discuss their phenomenology."

Novel features include spectra with essential singularities in $\alpha $ and violations of the relation $r+8n_{\text{t}}=0$ to the leading order. Various classes of potentials studied in the literature can be described by means of the RG approach, even when the action includes a Weyl-squared term, while others are left out.

However, it is not possible to solve analytically the constraint equation of the auxiliary field for a general $F(R)$. We propose a method that allows us to circumvent this issue and compute the inflationary observables. We apply this method to test scenarios of the form $F(R) = R + \alpha R^n$ and find that, as in the previously known $n=2$ case, a large $\alpha$ suppresses the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$.

We prove that for all such Palatini $F(R)$'s, there exists a universal strong coupling limit corresponding to a quadratic $F(R)$ with the wrong sign for the linear term and a cosmological constant in the Jordan frame. In such a limit, the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ does not depend on the original inflaton potential, while the scalar spectral index $n_s$ does. Unfortunately, the system is ill-defined out of the slow-roll regime. A possible way out is to upgrade to a $F(R,X)$ model, with $X$ the Jordan frame inflaton kinetic term.

We consider inflationary potentials that fit the CMB and lead to PBH dark matter with $i)$ asteroid, $ii)$ solar, or $iii)$ Planck mass, as well as $iv)$ PBHs that form the seeds of supermassive black holes. We find that stochastic effects enhance the PBH abundance by a factor of $\mathcal{O}(10)-\mathcal{O}(10^8)$, depending on the PBH mass.

The case of elmerice parts and gerd neggo,https://ojs.utlib.ee/index.php/methis/article/view/18450,http://dx.doi.org/10.7592/methis.v22i27/28.18450,1920s | Early modern dance | Elmerice Parts | Gender performativity | Gerd Neggo | Judith Butler,,"Elmerice Parts and Gerd Neggo were among the first female modern choreographers in Estonia. The present article takes a close look at how they did gender in their early modern dance productions and how they performed gender in their daily lives in the 1920s.K‰esolevas artiklis otsin vastust k√ºsimusele, kuidas kujutasid Eesti varased moderntantsijad ja koreograafid oma tantsulavastustes naisi. Lisaks sellele huvitab mind, missugused naised nad ise olid. Kas nende lavategelased ja nende endi eluk‰igud olid √¢‚Ç¨≈ætraditsioonilised√¢‚Ç¨≈ì v√µi iseloomustas neid moodsus? Moderntantsule pandi L‰‰ne-Euroopas ja P√µhja-Ameerikas alus 20. sajandi alguses. Selle eestvedajateks olid peamiselt naised, kellele uus tantsustiil andis ennen‰gematu v√µimaluse luua ise oma tantsud. Varased moderntantsijad ei kasutanud balletitehnikat ning h√ºlgasid baleriinile kohustuslikud kost√º√ºmielemendid. Uurimuse fookus lasub kahel tantsijal ja koreograafil, Elmerice Partsil (1878&1974) ja Gerd Neggol (1891&1974). Vaatluse all on nende 1920. aastate soolotantsud ning Partsi ja Herman Oginsky (ka Kolt-Oginsky ja Heiko Kolt, 1902&1977) duod.Judith Butler on seisukohal, et sool puudub stabiilne identiteet, sest sugu √¢‚Ç¨≈ætehakse√¢‚Ç¨≈ì. V‰ljaspool seda performatiivsust sugu ei eksisteeri. Terminite naine ja mees v√µi naiselik ja mehelik sisu on ajas muutuv, s√µltudes praktikatest, mille taasesitamist peetakse kas √¢‚Ç¨≈ænaiselikuks√¢‚Ç¨≈ì v√µi √¢‚Ç¨≈æmehelikuks√¢‚Ç¨≈ì ehk sellest, kuidas sugu √¢‚Ç¨≈ætehakse√¢‚Ç¨≈ì. Naiseks ei s√ºnnita, vaid naiseks saadakse, on Judith Butler veendunud sarnaselt Simone de Beauvoir'iga. Kuidas sugu √¢‚Ç¨≈ætehakse√¢‚Ç¨≈ì, on ajas muutuv: 1920. aastatel olid ettekirjutused √¢‚Ç¨≈ænaistele√¢‚Ç¨≈ì ja √¢‚Ç¨≈æmeestele√¢‚Ç¨≈ì teistsugused kui praegu. Missugused naisekujud t√µid Eesti esimesed naiskoreograafid lavale? Kas nende looming aitas kinnistada ideed naise √¢‚Ç¨≈ætraditsioonilistest√¢‚Ç¨≈ì rollidest v√µi panustas selle kummutamisse? Koreograafide arusaamad j√µuavad tantsuks transformeerununa suhteliselt suure vaatajaskonnani, mist√µttu on oluline, kuidas nad √ºht v√µi teist sugupoolt laval kujutavad. Esitades laval alternatiivseid olemise viise, tutvustab koreograaf oma publikule teistsugust v√µi uut soo √¢‚Ç¨≈ætegemise√¢‚Ç¨≈ì viisi. Sellega panustab ta √ºhiskondliku normi muutmisesse, mida me soolistatud subjektidena oleme paratamatult sunnitud tsiteerima.Uurimuse peamiseks allikaks on Eesti tr√ºkimeedias ilmunud artiklid: kriitikute arvustused ning teated tantsuetenduste ja koreograafide tegemiste kohta (nt esinemine v‰lismaal). Artiklite leidmiseks kasutasin Rahvusraamatukogu digitaalarhiivi DIGAR, kokku √µnnestus mul leida 88 artiklit ja teadaannet. Nimetatud allikad ei v√µimaldanud teada saada, kuidas tantsijannad end laval v‰ljendasid, vaid kuidas (peamiselt meessoost) kriitikud nende loomingut arvustasid. Kuna koreograafide endi tantsualaseid m‰rkmeid s‰ilinud ei ole, pakuvad nimetatud allikad peaaegu ainsat v√µimalust Eesti varase moderntantsu kohta midagi j‰reldada. Partsi ja Neggo loodud naisekujude iseloomustamiseks anal√º√ºsisin fraase, millega kriitikud kirjeldasid ja iseloomustasid nende tantsuloomingut ja liigutusi. Koreograafide eluk‰ikudele hinnangu andmiseks koostasin nende biograafiad ja v√µrdlesin neid 1920. aastatel valitsenud ideega √¢‚Ç¨≈ætraditsioonilisest naisest√¢‚Ç¨≈ì. Koreograafide biograafiad panin kokku tr√ºkimeediast p‰rit info p√µhjal, idee √¢‚Ç¨≈ætraditsioonilisest naisest√¢‚Ç¨≈ì konstrueerisin teemakohaste uurimuste p√µhjal.Parts ja Neggo kuulusid kahtlemata moodsate ja iseseisvate naiste hulka. Nad harisid end v‰lismaal ning t√∂√∂tasid seej‰rel elukutseliste tantsijate, koreograafide ja pedagoogidena. M√µlemad olid abielus, bioloogilisi lapsi ei olnud kummalgi. Nad t√µestasid, et naisel on v√µimalik realiseerida end v‰ljaspool kodu. 1920. aastatel ei peetud kodust v‰ljaspool tegutsevat naist √¢‚Ç¨≈ætraditsiooniliseks√¢‚Ç¨≈ì, valitses arvamus, et naise koht on kodus, kus tema peamiseks vastutusalaks on lapsed ja majapidamine. √¢‚Ç¨≈æTraditsioonilist√¢‚Ç¨≈ì naist peeti √µrnaks, n√µrgaks, lapsikuks, leebeks, tundlikuks, passiivseks ja ebakindlaks (Poska-Gr√ºnthal 1936; Kivimaa 2005, 34; Hinrikus 2011, 40).Missuguse naise t√µid Parts ja Neggo oma tantsulavastustes publiku ette? Partsi looming muutus tema karj‰‰ri jooksul m‰rkimisv‰‰rselt. 1920. aastate alguses kirjeldasid kriitikud teda kui h√µljuvat, graatsilist ja r√µ√µmsat tantsijat, veidi hiljem iseloomustati tema tantsuloomingut kui j√µulist, haaravat ja k√ºtkestavat (siin ja allpool olen artiklitest p‰rit terminid kirjutanud kaldkirjas). Veelgi enam muutus Partsi esteetika 1926. aastal, kui tema tantsupartneriks sai Herman Oginsky. Kriitikud kasutasid nende etteasteid arvustades sageli termineid erootiline ja akrobaatiline.Neggost sai Rudolf von Labani √µpilasena Eestis √¢‚Ç¨≈æuue tantsu√¢‚Ç¨≈ì (Saksamaal nimetati seda stiili terminiga Ausdruckstanz) esindaja. Erinevalt plastilistest tantsijatest, keda kriitikute s√µnul iseloomustas impressionistlik magusus, kirjeldati Neggo tantsuliigutusi kui t‰pseid, julgeid, ekspressiivseid, energeetilisi, unikaalseid, j√µulisi ja kergeid. Kuna koreograaf eitas literatuuri, assotsiatsioone ja sisu, m√µjus tema looming mitmete arvustajate s√µnul abstraktsena.Neile allikatele tuginedes v√µib v‰ita, et 1920. aastate jooksul eemaldus koreograafide loodud naisekuju √ºha tugevamini √¢‚Ç¨≈ætraditsioonilisest√¢‚Ç¨≈ì. Kui Partsi 1920. aastate alguse graatsiline, h√µljuv ja r√µ√µmus lavakuju ei erinenud kuigiv√µrd √¢‚Ç¨≈ætraditsioonilisest naisest√¢‚Ç¨≈ì, siis j√µulisuse lisandudes m√µned aastad hiljem eemaldub ta sellest m√µnev√µrra. V‰ljakutse valitsevale soonormile esitas Neggo oma abstraktse tantsuloominguga, mida anon√º√ºmse kriitiku s√µnul ei inspireerinud emotsioon, vaid m√µistus. √¢‚Ç¨≈æTraditsiooniline naine√¢‚Ç¨≈ì oli teatavasti tundlik ja intellektuaalselt saamatu. Partsi ja Oginsky erootilised tantsud kujutasid endast midagi radikaalselt uut, presenteerides naist kirgliku, sensuaalse ja iharana.Tuues lavale √¢‚Ç¨≈æebatraditsioonilisi√¢‚Ç¨≈ì naisekujusid, n‰itasid koreograafid, et sugu saab √¢‚Ç¨≈æteha√¢‚Ç¨≈ì mitmel moel. Nad demonstreerisid, et naine v√µib olla graatsiline, j√µuline, m√µistuslik, erootiline. Sellega esitasid Parts ja Neggo v‰ljakutse valitsevale soonormile ja aitasid muuta arusaamist sellest, mida pidada √¢‚Ç¨≈ænaiselikuks√¢‚Ç¨≈ì v√µi √¢‚Ç¨≈æmehelikuks√¢‚Ç¨≈ì."

To avoid technological solutionism that often accompanies biosensor applications in performing art, an artistic interventions approach was used. This paper describes a recent art-science residency consisting of three artistic experiments: the audience's electrodermal, activity-driven soundscape in a dance improvisation, a √¢‚Ç¨≈ìlie detector√¢‚Ç¨¬ù applied to the actor just after the performance, and a heart-rate-driven personal discotheque installation. Both artist and scientist provide reflections on future development of this transdisciplinary field from the performing art perspective.N√º√ºdisaegne interaktiivne teater toetub tehnoloogilistele uuendustele ja j‰rjest enam kasutatakse uusi tehnoloogiaid ka kunstiteose sisu loomisel: on need siis vaatajate reaktsioone tajuvad riided, voogteatri etendus v√µi vaatajate neurof√ºsioloogilisi reaktsioone m√µ√µtvad sensorid. Etenduskunstnik Taavet Jansen ja neuroteadlane Aleksander V‰ljam‰e t√∂√∂tasid publiku ja esinejate f√ºsioloogiliste reaktsioonidega kunstiteaduse residentuuris Tallinna √úlikoolis veebruarist 2019 kuni juunini 2019. F√ºsioloogilisi reaktsioone uuriti kolme kunstilise eksperimendi jooksul v√µi j‰rel ning see artikkel kirjeldabki neid eksperimente, kunstniku m√µtisklusi oma uurimisreisist ja arutleb, kuidas selliseid interaktsiooniv√µimalusi saaks kasutada voogteatri platvormidel. Iga kirjeldatud eksperimendi kohta avaldavad autorid ka oma m√µtteid ja teevad ettepanekuid, mida eksperimendi kordamisel v√µiks teha teistmoodi.Kunstilises eksperimendis √¢‚Ç¨≈æNeurokoreograafiline eksperiment nr 4√¢‚Ç¨≈ì kasutati interaktiivset lahendust, kus neljale vaatajale kinnitatud sensorid m√µ√µtsid nende erutuse taset (electrodermal activity galvanic skin response) improvisatsioonilise tantsuetenduse v‰ltel Tallinnas, Kanuti Gildi SAALis 06.06.2019. Vaatajate reaktsioone kasutati reaalajas helikujunduse manipuleerimisel. Selline interaktiivne lahendus tekitas kunstiliselt intrigeeriva tagasiside-efekti, kus vaatajate tahtmatud reaktsioonid hakkasid m√µjutama kogu lavastuse tervikut. Vaatajad said tahtmatult endale √¢‚Ç¨≈æh‰‰le√¢‚Ç¨≈ì, mida said interpreteerida k√µik osalised kogu terviku kontekstis.Kunstilises eksperimendis √¢‚Ç¨≈æMacbeth√¢‚Ç¨≈ì kasutati erutust m√µ√µtvaid sensoreid, salvestamaks n‰itleja reaktsioone intervjuu ajal, kus esitati k√ºsimusi tema rolliloome kohta etenduses, mis oli l√µppenud 10 minutit enne intervjuu algust. Tegemist oli Alo K√µrve Macbethi rolliga Tallinna Linnateatri lavastuses √¢‚Ç¨≈æMacbeth√¢‚Ç¨≈ì. Prokur√∂r Steven-Hristo Evestuse l‰bi viidud intervjuu eesm‰rgiks oli m√µista, milliseid tehnikaid kasutab n‰itleja oma rolli luues, ning tehnoloogiat kasutades anal√º√ºsida, kas n‰itleja on teadlik laval tehtud otsustest.Heli- ja valgusinstallatsioon √¢‚Ç¨≈æHeartrate Party√¢‚Ç¨≈ì p√µhines kontseptsioonil, kus k√ºlastaja s√ºdamer√ºtm m√µjutas kogu installatsiooni heli- ja valguskujunduse tempot. S√ºdamer√ºtmi m√µ√µdeti spetsiaalse sensoriga ja kasutatud videokujundus nii instrueeris osalejaid kui ka andis tagasisidet √µnnestumisest v√µi eba√µnnestumisest. Installatsioon oli avatud Tallinnas, Kanuti Gildi SAALi keldrisaalis 05.&07.06.2020 ja seda k√ºlastas 20 vaatajat.aasta esimeses pooles, kui COVID-19 pandeemia p√µhjustas eriolukorra kogu maailmas, ei tohtinud teatrid ja etendusasutused avalikke √ºritusi korraldada. Teatrid hakkasid oma etendusi andma voogedastust v√µimaldavatel platvormidel. Kuna voogteater avab etenduste m‰ngimiseks palju uusi v√µimalusi, siis me anal√º√ºsime residentuuris kasutatud kontseptsioone ka voogteatri perspektiivist. K√µiki eelpool mainitud kontseptsioone oleks v√µimalik osaliselt kanda √ºle ka veebikeskkonda, kuid need eeldavad kasutajapoolset tehnoloogilist valmisolekut. Sensortehnoloogiad v√µimaldavad voogteatri etenduste vaatajate reaktsioone ja k‰itumist anal√º√ºsida ja salvestada. Kuna nende tehnoloogiate kasutus sellises kontekstis on veel uus, siis k√ºsimused, mis puudutavad eetikat ja isikuandmeid, vajavad alles v‰ljat√∂√∂tamist.Kokkuv√µttes v‰idame, et v‰ga palju uurimist√∂√∂d on alles ees ja meetodid, kuidas interpreteerida esinejatelt ja vaatajatelt kogutud andmeid, on alles vaja v‰lja t√∂√∂tada. Tihti kasutatakse andmeid interaktsiooni eesm‰rgil pigem otseseid t√µlgendusi luues & biosignaalide numbriline v‰‰rtus t√µlgitakse otse m√µneks audiovisuaalses kujunduses oluliseks v‰‰rtuseks. Selline t√µlgendus annab k√ºll laval toimuvale perfektse s√ºnkrooni, kuid vastust j‰‰b ootama oluline k√ºsimus, mida need andmed v‰ljendavad, mida nad t‰hendavad. Kunstis j‰‰b tihti puudu teoreetilistest teadmistest, mis aitaksid intuitiivselt tehtud kunstilisi otsuseid raamistada. Selline teadmiste √ºlekandmine kunsti ja teaduse vahel avaks uusi v√µimalusi kunstiteoste interpreteerimisel, aga ka teaduse rikastamisel."

On performative space in Estonian contemporary performing arts.,https://ojs.utlib.ee/index.php/methis/article/view/18444,https://doi.org/10.7592/methis.v22i27/28.18444,,,"This paper discusses examples of the use of performative space in the Estonian performing arts. It shows how a performative space is arranged as an interactive and shared space, what the features are of an installation space, how the audience perceives immersive space, and how a socially communicative space is formed. The paper studies the ways that space can be an active agent and affect the perception of the spectator.Artikkel k‰sitleb ruumi organiseerimise viise uuemas Eesti teatris ning osutab, kuidas ruumilised suhted m√µjutavad publiku taju. Anal√º√ºsitakse viit 2020. aastal esietendunud lavastust: √¢‚Ç¨≈æKas te olete oma kohaga rahul√¢‚Ç¨≈ì (autorid Eero Epner, Mart Kangro ja Juhan Ulfsak, Kanuti Gildi SAAL), √¢‚Ç¨≈æ*******√¢‚Ç¨≈ì (autorid Mart Koldits ja trupp, Von Krahli Teater), √¢‚Ç¨≈æ√úmarlaud√¢‚Ç¨≈ì (lavastaja Kadri Noormets, Tartu Uus Teater), √¢‚Ç¨≈æInimesed ja numbrid√¢‚Ç¨≈ì (lavastaja Birgit Landberg, Vaba Lava) ning √¢‚Ç¨≈æsupersocial√¢‚Ç¨≈ì (autorid √ú√ºve-Lydia Toompere ja Siim T√µniste, Kanuti Gildi SAALi kaasproduktsioon).Ruum on teatrikunstis m‰‰rav m√µ√µde ning √ºks v√µimalus teatrit defineerida ongi n‰ha seda ruumi eriomase organiseerimise kaudu. Teoreetilise raamistikuna vaadeldakse artiklis Gay McAuley' viiest alast koosnevat teatriruumide taksonoomiat. Esimeseks alaks on McAuley' taksonoomia j‰rgi teatrikogemuse sotsiaalne reaalsus, mis koosneb teatriruumist, publikuruumist, etenduse ruumist, t√∂√∂tajate ruumist ja prooviruumist. Teiseks alaks on f√º√ºsilise reaalsuse ja fiktsionaalse ruumi duaalsus, mis koosneb lavaruumist, esituse ruumist ja fiktsionaalsest ruumist. Kolmanda alana toob McAuley v‰lja ruumid, mis on seotud asukoha ja fiktsiooniga, r√µhutamaks, et v‰ljam√µeldud ruum toimib vastavalt oma asukohale f√º√ºsilise reaalsuse suhtes. Neljanda alana k‰sitletakse tekstilist ruumi, mis p√∂√∂rab t‰helepanu etendusteksti ruumilistele struktuuridele ja nende t‰htsusele etenduse geneesis, h√µlmates muu hulgas geograafilisi nimesid, kohtade kirjeldusi, liikumist v‰ljendavaid verbe jms. Viienda alana toob McAuley esile temaatilise ruumi, mille t‰htsus seisneb t‰henduste loomises ja mis on seotud nii teksti kui ka etendusega. (McAuley 2000, 24&32) K‰esolevas artiklis v√µetakse sellest taksonoomiast kasutusele etenduse ruumi m√µiste, mis kuulub teatrikogemuse sotsiaalse reaalsuse juurde. McAuley' etenduse ruumis t√∂√∂tavad kaks gruppi, etendajad ja vaatajad koos, et luua √ºhine etenduskogemus. Etenduse ruum on teatrit m‰‰ratlev ruum ning eksisteerib ka siis, kui pole olemas teatrit kui hoonet. (McAuley 2000, 26)Teiseks ja peamiseks teoreetiliseks raamistuseks tuuakse artiklis m‰ngu Erika Fischer-Lichte performatiivse ruumi m√µiste. Performatiivne on Fischer-Lichte (2008, 107) m‰‰ratluses ruum, milles etendus ilmneb, ja see ruum s√ºnnib etendajate ja vaatajate koostoimes. Performatiivne ruum avab mitmekesiseid suhteid etendajate ja vaatajate, liikumise ja taju vahel. Nende suhete √ºksk√µik millisel viisil muutmine v√µi kehtestamine muudab performatiivset ruumi. Performatiivset ruumi nimetab Fischer-Lichte ka vahepealseks ruumiks ja etenduse k‰igus on see pidevas muutumises. Selle ruumi k‰sitluses t√µstetakse esile etenduse tajumise aspekti: publiku taju m√µjutab alati etendust ja k√µiki selles osalejaid, nii et etenduse ruumis hakkab ringlema erip‰rane energia (Fischer-Lichte 2008, 59). Lisaks muutuvad suhted n‰itlejate ja vaatajate vahel s√µltuvalt publiku asetusest: olenevalt sellest, kas publik istub saalis vaatega lavale, kas publik √ºmbritseb lava v√µi seisab publikuruumis hajutatult, kas publik liigub √ºmber ristk√ºlikukujulise v√µi ruudukujulise lava v√µi siis sellest, mil viisil on publik lavast eraldatud (pro√Ö¬æektorite, poodiumite, dekoratsiooni, m√∂√∂bli vmt-ga) (Fischer-Lichte 2008, 107).Artiklis arutletakse ruumi kui aktiivse agendi √ºle. Lavastuste √¢‚Ç¨≈æKas te olete oma kohaga rahul√¢‚Ç¨≈ì ja √¢‚Ç¨≈æ*******√¢‚Ç¨≈ì kaasav ja jagatud ruum ‰rgitab publikut tajuma tuntud teatriruumi uuel viisil ning aktiveerib vaataja isikliku m‰lu, emotsioonid ja kogemused. √¢‚Ç¨≈æ√úmarlaua√¢‚Ç¨≈ì installatiivne ruum aktiveerib m‰letamise kui f√º√ºsilise toimingu: etendajad m‰ngivad laval p‰ris m‰nge ja see vallandab iga vaataja enda elu m‰lestusv‰‰rsed hetked. Sellised lavastused taasm√µtestavad teatriruumi ja publik saab v√µimaluse tajuda tavap‰rast teatriruumi uuel viisil.Lavastuste √¢‚Ç¨≈æKas te olete oma kohaga rahul√¢‚Ç¨≈ì, √¢‚Ç¨≈æ*******√¢‚Ç¨≈ì ja √¢‚Ç¨≈æ√úmarlaud√¢‚Ç¨≈ì ruumilised suhted aktiveerivad osalejate emotsionaalse ruumi, m‰luruumi ja kogemuste ruumi. Oluline √ºhine aspekt on see, et ruumiline paigutus k‰ivitab isiklikud m‰lestused. Vaatajad hakkavad m√µtisklema oma mineviku √ºle: kuidas nad on tajunud ruumilisi suhteid oma elu eri etappidel. Anal√º√ºsitud lavastused n‰itavad, kuidas aktiivne performatiivne ruum v√µib h√µlmata publiku kuulmis-, n‰gemis-, l√µhna- ja taktiilse taju, s.t etendus √ºmbritseb osav√µtjaid ning nad kogevad etendust eri tajude abil.Lavastus √¢‚Ç¨≈æsupersocial√¢‚Ç¨≈ì on n‰ide sellest, kuidas lisaks f√º√ºsilise ruumi spetsiifilisele korraldusele v√µib teater keskenduda ka sotsiaalsele ruumile ning laiendada kommunikatsiooniruumi. See rakendusteatrina tajutav lavastus l√µi ajutise kogukonna, mille potentsiaalne aruteluv‰li ulatub v‰ljapoole teatris√ºndmust nii ajas kui ka ruumis.K‰esolevas artiklis huvituti n√º√ºdisteatri performatiivsest ruumist, s.t ruumist, kus etendus toimub. Erinevalt arhitektuurilis-geomeetrilisest ruumist ei esinda performatiivne ruum ainult f√º√ºsilisi artefakte. Oma olemuselt kuulub performatiivne ruum pigem s√ºndmuste kui kunstiteoste juurde (Fischer-Lichte 2008, 114). Lisaks performatiivse ruumi s√ºndmuslikkusele on siin kohaldatav ka situatsiooni m√µiste: vaatajast saab osav√µtja ning seel‰bi saab ta teadlikumaks oma kohalolust (oma positsioonist teiste inimeste suhtes ruumis), lisaks v√µib f√º√ºsiline l‰hedus h√µlmata otsest kontakti etendajate ja vaatajate vahel (Lehmann 2006, 123).Kokkuv√µtvalt n‰idati artiklis, kuidas ruum v√µib olla aktiivne agent ja m√µjutada publiku taju. Artikkel pakkus v√µimalust k‰sitleda ruumi kui etenduse aspekti, mis aktiveerib publiku, ja n‰itas, kuidas etenduse kulg v√µib s√µltuda publiku tegevusest v√µi tegevusetusest."

Markers for preferred playing as an alternative to more traditional close reading are discussed together with concepts and insights from contemporary game studios and game design regarding the medium's different layers.K‰esolev artikkel loob Stuart Halli (1973) eelistatud lugemise (preferred reading) k‰sitluse alusel eelistatud m‰ngimise (preferred playing) kontseptsiooni, kasutades selleks Cass Sunsteini ja Richard Thaleri (2008) n√ºgimise (nudge) m√µistet, et luua uus l‰henemine tekstianal√º√ºsile, mis oleks sobiv videom‰ngude kui interaktiivse meediumi anal√º√ºsiks. Koos m√µistete ja uuendustega n√º√ºdisaegsest ludoloogiast ja m‰ngudisainist arutatakse eelistatud m‰ngimise markereid kui alternatiivi levinumale l‰hilugemisele videom‰ngu meediumi eri kihistuste uurimiseks.Artikli alguses on v‰lja toodud varasemate kvalitatiivsete ja kvantitatiivsete l‰henemiste problemaatika videom‰nguanal√º√ºsis, mis on eriti m‰rgatav siis, kui k‰sitletakse rassi, klassi ja soo kujutamist videom‰ngudes. Kuna varasemates l‰henemistes j‰‰b tihti puudu objektiivsusest ning tihtipeale kujutatakse videom‰nge, v‰ltimatult interaktiivset meediumit, ka liiga lihtsustatult, soovitan kaheosalist l‰henemist videom‰nguanal√º√ºsile. Alustuseks pakun ma potentsiaalsete tegevuste ja s√ºndmuste kaardistamise videom‰ngudes, v√µttes aluseks Fern√É¬°ndez-Vara (2015) kontseptsiooni v√µimalusruumist (space of possibilities).Kuigi see aitab videom‰nge m√µista terviklikena, ei piisa sellest siiski m‰ngusiseste vaatepunktide ja ideoloogiate anal√º√ºsiks, sest need on tihti kodeeritud eelistama √ºht v√µi teist valikut. Seet√µttu loon ma Halli (1973) m√µiste √¢‚Ç¨≈æeelistatud lugemine√¢‚Ç¨≈ì (preferred reading) alusel, koos selle alla kuuluvate vastanduva (oppositional) ja sobitava (negotiated) lugemise m√µistetega, kontseptsiooni eelistatud m‰ngimisest (preferred playing). Sel eesm‰rgil kasutan ma Thaleri ja Sunsteini (2008) terminit √¢‚Ç¨≈æn√ºgimine√¢‚Ç¨≈ì (nudge), pakkudes v‰lja, et videom‰ng ise markeerib ideaalse viisi enda m‰ngimiseks. Eelistatud m‰ngimine on seega domineeriv m‰ngustiil, mis on tuletatud neist n√ºgimistest, mida m‰ng m‰ngijale esitab; vastanduv m‰ngimine on m‰ngustiil, mis tunneb need n√ºgimised k√ºll ‰ra, kuid vastandub neile tahtlikult, n‰iteks l√µhestava v√µi etendusliku m‰ngimise eesm‰rgil. Sobitav m‰ngimine seevastu aga kaasab tihti eelistatud m‰ngimist, kuid muudab seda vastavalt m‰ngija soovidele. Selleks, et m√µista, millised n√ºgimised videom‰ngudes moodustavad eelistatud m‰ngimise, on vaja anal√º√ºsida videom‰ngude erinevaid aspekte ja kihistusi. N√ºgimine on eriti tavap‰rane nn visuaalsete vaikes‰tete puhul, kuid esineb ka paljudes m‰ngumehhaanika detailides, n‰iteks tasakaalustamises, keerukuses ja v‰ljakutsetes, aga ka eesm‰rkides ja auhindades. T‰hendusrikas tasemedisain ja √Ö¬æanri- ning narratiivielementide kasutamine kujundavad t‰iendavalt kujutluspilti ideaalsest teekonnast l‰bi videom‰ngu s√ºndmuste, mille p√µhjal saavad seega tuletada videom‰ngu eelistatud m‰ngimise nii m‰ngijad ise kui ka ludoloogid.Kirjeldatud metodoloogia abil saab luua l‰hteteksti, anal√º√ºsimaks videom‰nge nii soo kujutamise osas kui ka n‰iteks rassi kujutamises, kuna alaesindatuse probleem on m√µlema aspekti puhul tavap‰rane (Williams jt 2009). Kuna tegemist on kohandatava t√∂√∂vahendiga videom‰ngude anal√º√ºsiks, saab seda vastavalt vajadusele kasutada ka koos teiste teoreetiliste l‰henemistega."

Is the most significant aspect of the translation and reception of Kaplinski's work circulation through centres of world literature, similarly to the conception of Pascale Casanova? Or, rather, has the literary communication between Estonian and Swedish literature taken the shape of a dialogue between two national cultures? Are there alternatives or combinations of these approaches? Using the example of Jaan Kaplinski's Swedish reception, I investigate what characterises the meeting between the fields of two (semi) peripheral national literatures, and what world literary contexts are expressed in the reception. I also identify and trace which interpretations of Kaplinski are distinctive in the Swedish literary field.Jaan Kaplinski loomingu rootsi retseptsioon ja maailmakirjanduse v‰lja avaldumineJaan Kaplinski loomingu rootsi retseptsioon ja maailmakirjanduse v‰lja avaldumineJaan Kaplinski (1941&2021) on rahvusvahelisemalt tuntuimaid eesti luuletajaid, kelle autorikogusid on ilmunud 20 keeles ning kui juurde arvata antoloogiates ilmunu ning proosa, on keeli √ºle 30. Rootsi keeles on tal ilmunud 11 teost, nii luulet kui proosat. Selles artiklis on l‰hema vaatluse all neist viis & eelk√µige k√µik luulekogud (1982; 1987; 1988; 2007) ning lisaks m√µttep‰evik √¢‚Ç¨≈æTitanic och isen√¢‚Ç¨≈ì (1997; eesti keeles √¢‚Ç¨≈æJ‰‰ ja Titanic√¢‚Ç¨≈ì, 1995).Artiklis anal√º√ºsin Jaan Kaplinski loomingu rootsikeelsete t√µlgete ilmumist ja nende vastuv√µttu arvustustes, et selgitada, kuidas on toimunud eesti kirjanduse ja rootsi kirjandusv‰lja vaheline suhtlus: kuiv√µrd m√µjutatud on Kaplinski rootsikeelne retseptsioon maailmakirjanduse keskuste kaudu k‰ivast kirjandusringlusest &√Ç¬† sarnaselt Pascale Casanova kontseptsiooniga (2007) & v√µi kuiv√µrd on tegemist peamiselt kahe rahvuskultuuri vahelise dialoogiga. On ka v√µimalus, et suhtluses olid olulised hoopis m√µned muud, n‰iteks poliitilised tegurid.Selgus, et Jaan Kaplinski n‰ite puhul on aktuaalsed m√µlemad d√ºnaamika v√µimalused ning need on omavahel ka p√µimunud. N‰ite p√µhjal paistab ka, et eesti ja rootsi kultuuri vahel on kirjanduslik kontakt olnud sujuvam siis, kui kirjaniku loomingut saab pidada semiperifeerse kultuuri osaks. Veel enam, selle juhtumi anal√º√ºs v√µimaldab t‰helepanu juhtida v√µimalusele, et v‰iksemad kultuurid saavad maailmakirjanduse ringlust (ja selle kaudu kaanonit) m√µjutada ka omavahelise t√µlketegevuse kaudu.K√µige oman‰olisemalt kahe rahvuskultuuri vahel s√ºndinud, kuid sellegipoolest globaalsema ambitsiooniga on Kaplinski retseptsioon esimese valikkogu puhul (1982), mis oma ilmumisega ennetab keskuste kaudu k‰ivat maailmakirjanduse liikumist. Arvustuste hulk oli siis veel k√ºll√Ç¬† tagasihoidlikum (6). Kaplinski teise, Kaljo P√µlluga koost√∂√∂s s√ºndinud t√µlkeraamatuga √¢‚Ç¨≈æBarn av vind och vatten√¢‚Ç¨≈ì (√¢‚Ç¨≈æTuule ja vee lapsed√¢‚Ç¨¬ù, 1987) j‰tkub erip‰rasem eestlaste ja rootslaste vaheline kirjandussuhtlus. Siiski v√µib aimata, et vastuv√µttu toetab n√º√ºdsest ka Kaplinski rahvusvahelise tuntuse t√µus, arvustuste hulk on veidi kasvanud (11). Kaplinski kolmanda luulekogu ilmumine Rootsis (1988) j‰ljendab v‰liselt, eelk√µige pealkirja √¢‚Ç¨≈æSamma hav i oss alla√¢‚Ç¨≈ì (√¢‚Ç¨≈æSeesama meri meis k√µigis√¢‚Ç¨≈ì) kaudu k√µige enam autori rahvusvahelise tuntuse narratiivi, kuigi sisult see kogu samanimelise ingliskeelse v‰ljaandega ei kattu. Keskuste kaudu k‰iva maailmakirjanduse ringluse m√µju on igatahes tugevamalt taustal, nagu on n‰ha ka Rootsis ilmunud arvustuste hulga suurenemisest (15) ja nende prominentsematest ilmumiskohtadest. Lisaks on Kaplinski esinenud raadios ja televisioonis ning olnud k√ºlaline Malm√∂ luulefestivalil. 1997. aastal ilmunud √¢‚Ç¨≈æTitanic och isen√¢‚Ç¨≈ì on teos, mille kohta on ilmunud k√µige rohkem arvustusi (21). Selleks ajaks oli t√µusnud ka Kaplinski rahvusvaheline tuntus ning mainimised Nobeli kirjanduspreemia kontekstis. Teose lokaalsemat tasandit r√µhutab asjaolu, et see ilmus m√µni aasta p‰rast Eesti&Rootsi suunal s√µitnud parvlaeva Estonia hukku. L√µpuks, 2007. aastal ilmunud valikkogu √¢‚Ç¨≈æN√É¬•gonstans vid v‰rldens kant√¢‚Ç¨≈ì (√¢‚Ç¨≈æKuskil maailma ‰‰rel√¢‚Ç¨≈ì) on justkui Kaplinski uustutvustus j‰rgmisele p√µlvkonnale p‰rast 18 aastat. 2000. aastate teise poole vastuv√µtu puhul paistab silma, et kirjanduse vahendamine tr√ºkimeedia kaudu on kahanenud. Vastukaja on mahuliselt v‰hem (6) ning see on osalt organiseeritud G√∂teborgi raamatumessi kontekstis, mis t√µi esile sotsiaalsemat, Eesti riigi v√µi rahvuse keskset l‰henemist kirjandusele.Uurisin ka, missugused maailmakirjanduslikud kontekstid Kaplinski loomingu vastuv√µtus veel avalduvad ning missugused t√µlgendused on erip‰rased just rootsi kirjandusv‰ljal.Esimese valikkogu √¢‚Ç¨≈æV√É¬•ra skuggor ‰r mycket l√É¬•nga√¢‚Ç¨≈ì (√¢‚Ç¨≈æMeie varjud on v‰ga pikad√¢‚Ç¨≈ì, 1982) puhul pandi kriitikute poolt k√µige enam t‰hele Kaplinski j√µulisemaid √∂koloogilise s√µnumiga luuletusi tema varasemast perioodist ning k√µige isikup‰rasemaks hinnati luuletaja loitsulikke-palvelikke luuletusi ts√ºklist √¢‚Ç¨≈æSeesama meri meis k√µigis√¢‚Ç¨≈ì. Kuna Kaplinski luulekogu avaldanud kirjastuses Fripress ilmusid samal ajal ka kolme teise Ida-Euroopa luuletaja raamatud ja neid ka arvustati √ºheskoos, on ka Kaplinski p‰ritolumaad tajutud osana suuremast regioonist.Kaplinski ja P√µllu teose √¢‚Ç¨≈æTuule ja vee lapsed√¢‚Ç¨≈ì (1987) puhul tajuti selle t√µukumist piirkondlikest rahvusk√ºsimustest (sh venestamisest) ja juurte otsimisest, kuid m‰rgati ka Kaplinski proosaluule kvaliteeti ning teose k√µrget esteetilist taset ja aktuaalsust avaramaski maailmakirjanduse kontekstis, sest teos kujutab kaasaegsete v‰ljendusvahenditega √ºrgset loodusrahvaste maailmataju. Esimest korda aktualiseerus ka arutelu eesti kultuuri p√µhjamaisuse √ºle.Kolmanda valikkogu √¢‚Ç¨≈æSeesama meri meis k√µigis√¢‚Ç¨≈ì (1988) arvustustest j‰id k√µlama √ºksikisiku √ºldistusj√µud, isikup‰rane voolav luulekeel ning detaili j√µud. Raamatu kontekstidest v√µib v‰lja tuua budistlikuma maailmatunnetuse ning luuletaja Bo Carpelani eess√µna tugevdab sidemeid p√µhjamaisema kirjandusv‰ljaga. Lisaks n‰gid kriitikud Kaplinski sidemeid m√µnede rootsi tippluuletajate vaimsusega (Tomas Transtr√∂mer, Gunnar Ekel√∂f), eriti selle pinnalt, kuidas √ºksikisiku kogemus saab universaalseks. Olgugi et poliitilise reaalsuse kujutamist on teoses v‰ga v‰he, l√µid kriitikud need seosed end huvitavate teemadega Kaplinski isiku v√µi tema varasema luule kaudu. Ka Ida-Euroopa kultuuriv‰li oli umbes kolmandikus arvustustest endiselt taustal.Selleks ajaks, kui ilmus m√µttep‰evik √¢‚Ç¨≈æTitanic och isen√¢‚Ç¨≈ì (1997), olid rootsi kriitikud juba teadlikumad Kaplinski autoriprofiilist. Osati m‰rgata tema omap‰rasid, tasast ja selget kirjutamislaadi, kauneid vaikust p√º√ºdvaid looduskirjeldusi, mikro- ja makrotasandi sidumist. Viimase, 2007. aastal ilmunud valikkogu arvustustes olid luuletaja tutvustused julgemalt maailmakirjanduse v‰ljal, kuid poeetika l‰hemal vaatlusel toetuti v√µrdlustele pigem rootsi autoritega, kuid siis just nendega, kellel on samuti suurem rahvusvaheline tuntus.Kaplinski teoste arvustuste sisuanal√º√ºsist selgub, et maailmakirjanduse v‰li avaldub vastuv√µtuprotsessis igal juhul & √ºldiselt pooltel juhtudel globaalsemas m√µ√µtmes ja pooltel juhtudel rahvuskultuuride vaheliselt. Tuli ka v‰lja, et teoste puhul, mida ei ole ilmunud suurtes kirjanduskeeltes, ei pruugi retseptsioon j‰‰da tingimata ainult kahe rahvuskultuuri vaheliseks & kirjanduskriitikas aktualiseerub pooltel juhtudel ka regionaalselt avaram v√µi globaalsem v‰li. Samuti tuli Eesti ja Rootsi n‰ite puhul v‰lja, kuidas kahe rahvuskultuuri vaheline kirjandussuhtlus kipub olema ka poliitiline, seega mitte ainult autonoomsel kirjandusv‰ljal. Edasiseks aruteluks v√µib v‰lja pakkuda h√ºpoteesi, et ehk ongi t√µlkekirjanduse ringlemisele k√µige kasulikum, kui kaasatud on m√µlemad, nii kahe rahvuse vaheline dialoog kui ka avaram maailmakirjanduslik kontekst."
2021,Raili Marling,Authenticity and Depthiness in the Representation of Affects: Perception and Performativity in Contemporary (Auto)Fiction / Autentsus ja s√ºgavuse illusioon afektide kujutamises: taju ja performatiivsus n√º√ºdisaegses ilukirjanduses ja autofiktsioonis,https://ojs.utlib.ee/index.php/methis/article/view/18441,https://doi.org/10.7592/methis.v22i27/28.18441,,,"This article analyses the tension between the perception and performance of affect in two contemporary texts: Heather Christle'sThe Crying Book(2019) and Christine Smallwood'sThe Life of the Mind(2021). Both subvert the expectation of feminine sentiment and pose questions about the authenticity of affect. Although affects are always mediated in fiction, experimental fictional texts have the potential for greater authenticity than the performative affective displays of the emotional public sphere.√úks afektiuuringute keskseid teoreetikuid Brian Massumi (2002b, 233) v‰idab, et t‰nap‰eval on√Ç¬† afekt olulisem m√µiste kui ideoloogia, sest v√µim toimib √ºha enam afektide abil. Kuna √ºldiselt vaadeldakse afekte kehaliste intensiivsustena, mida ei saa teadlikult kontrollida, siis peetakse neid autentseiks, seda ka t‰nap‰eval, mil autentse ja v√µltsi piir on √ºha ‰hmasem. Kuigi √ºksikisiku tasandil on afektid t√µesti raskesti kontrollitavad, on eri valdkondade teadlased n‰idanud, et afekte on v√µimalik kunstlikult esile kutsuda, nt poliitiliste v√µi turunduskampaaniate v√µi ka kogemusturismi abil. Seega v‰‰rib afektide autentsus l‰hemat anal√º√ºsi.K‰esolev artikkel v‰idab, et afektid, mida me avalikus sf‰‰ris kohtame, on performatiivsed: nad l‰htuvad sotsiaalsetest normidest ja tsiteerivad varasemaid afektiivseid esitusi, mis on korduste t√µttu omandanud autentsuse aura. Afektide performatiivsus ei t‰henda, et nad on v√µltsid; lihtsalt me ei tohiks nende siirust √ºle hinnata. Ka performatiivsed afektid k√µnetavad teisi inimesi ning tekitavad autentseid afektiivseid reaktsioone. Afektid liiguvad kehalt kehale, nagu v‰idab Anna Gibbs (2001, 1), aga ka teatrilavalt, kinolinalt v√µi raamatulehek√ºlgedelt publikuni. Seega v‰‰rib afektide kujutamine ja selle performatiivsus l‰hemat t‰helepanu kirjanduse ja teiste kunstivormide anal√º√ºsis. Jennifer Doyle (2013, 85) v‰idab, et kui emotsioonist saab emotsiooni representatsioon, siis kerkivad kohe k√ºsimused selle emotsiooni autentsuse kohta. Kuigi tekstidesse k‰tketud emotsioon v√µi afekt on alati mugandus ja ehk isegi manipulatsioon, ei kaota see oma v‰ge publikut k√µnetada ja selles afekte luua. Palju on uuritud etenduskunsti, mis r√ºndab vaatajate meeli ja ootusi ning ka lugejas tugevaid emotsioone tekitavaid traumanarratiive. V‰hem on t‰helepanu saanud raskesti loetavad ja n‰ilised tundetud kirjandustekstid, mille afektiivne laeng on ambivalentsem. Aga ka sellistel tekstidel on potentsiaal pakkuda inimestele uudseid viise maailmaga suhestumiseks (Berlant ja Prosser 2011, 182).Artikkel keskendub konkreetselt √ºhele autentseks peetavale afektiivsele fenomenile, pisaratele. Pisarad on √ºks ilmsemaid afektide ilminguid, mida me ei kontrolli ning mis seega n‰ivad autentseina. Samas juba Roland Barthes (2002) juhib t‰helepanu pisarate dialoogilisusele ja suisa manipulatiivsusele. Pisarad on seega huvitav n‰ide afektide autentsuse ja performatiivsuse anal√º√ºsimiseks, seda enam, et pisaraid kasutatakse mitmesugustes kunstilistes ja kirjanduslikes tekstides afektide t‰histajana.Artikkel l‰htub Eugenie Brinkema (2014, 4) soovitusest otsida tekstidest afektide tekstilisi kujutusi, et hoiduda afektiuuringutele tihti omasest subjektiivsusest ning liikuda pelgalt afektide tarbimiselt s√ºgavama teoreetilise anal√º√ºsini. Brinkema (2014, 37) soovitab otsida afektide vormi, mis v√µimaldab anal√º√ºsides olla t‰helepanelikum kirjandusteksti stiililise keerukuse ja n√ºansirikkuse suhtes. Seega vaatleb artikkel kirjandusteksti keelelisi v‰ljendusvahendeid kui afektide esitamise ja loomise vahendeid.Artiklis anal√º√ºsitakse kaht n√º√ºdiskirjanduse n‰idet, mis eksperimenteerivad pisarate kujutamisega. Esimeseks tekstiks on Heather Christle'i autobiograafia sugemetega essee √¢‚Ç¨≈æThe Crying Book√¢‚Ç¨≈ì (√¢‚Ç¨≈æNuturaamat√¢‚Ç¨≈ì, 2019)√Ç¬† ja teine Christine Smallwoodi romaan √¢‚Ç¨≈æThe Life of the Mind√¢‚Ç¨≈ì (√¢‚Ç¨≈æVaimuelu√¢‚Ç¨≈ì, 2021). Neid tekste v√µiks vaadelda uussiiruse n‰itena, kuid artikkel v‰idab pigem, et m√µlemad autorid k√ºsim‰rgistavad naiselikkuse ja naiskogemusega seondatavat sentimentaalset siirust. Pisaraid kasutatakse √ºhtaegu lugeja k√µnetamiseks ja samaaegselt lihtsa pinnalugemise √µ√µnestamiseks. Pisarad on performatiivsed, kuid samas ka autentsed, signaliseerides lugejale, et teiste afektide t‰hendus j‰‰b meile alati k‰ttesaamatuks. Pisarad ei allu √ºhesele t√µlgendusele, n‰idates autentse ja performatiivse vahelise piiri poorsust.T‰nap‰eva menukite hulgas on palju m‰lestusi, traumanarratiive ja pihtimisi, milles m‰lu on suunatud tunnete voolus‰ngi (Shields 2010, 56). Sellised tihti kommertslikult pakendatud kogemused on muutunud piiravaiks, sest nad pakuvad liiga kergesti loetavaid ja tarbitavaid stereot√º√ºpseid emotsioone. Artiklis anal√º√ºsitud tekstid julgevad sellele kergesti loetavuse ja tarbitavuse kiusatusele vastu hakata. Nad toovad meid n‰iliselt turvalisse sentimentaalse pihtimuse maailma, kuid siis eemaldavad selged teet‰hised ja j‰tavad meid omap‰i autentsuse ja performatiivsuse piire kompama. Selline strateegia tekitab l√µhe lugeja ja teksti vahel, kuid just selle l√µhe √ºletamiseks tehtud j√µupingutus aitab meil m√µista n‰iliselt selgete afektide tegelikku mitmet‰henduslikkust. Kuigi kirjanduslikud afektid on alati vahendatud, on eksperimentaalses kirjanduses v‰hemalt potentsiaal murda v‰lja stereot√º√ºpidele √ºles ehitatud emotsionaalse avaliku sf‰‰ri turvalisest tarbijas√µbralikkusest ning meenutada meile elatud kogemuse vastur‰‰kivust ja metsikust."

The category of person is the most√Ç¬†controversial√Ç¬†category concerning imperatives. The scope of the functions of imperatives√Ç¬†has also received a lot of attention. This study focuses on the distribution of the√Ç¬†person forms of the Livonian jussive and the covariance between function and person.√Ç¬†Jussive occurrences from two corpora have been analysed for person and function,√Ç¬†cross-referenced, and analysed for prototypicality of function. The Livonian jussive is√Ç¬†most frequently used in the third person, but all person forms are attested. All forms√Ç¬†occur in prototypical and non-prototypical imperative functions, but the first-person√Ç¬†forms are used more frequently for non-prototypical functions, while other forms are√Ç¬†used more often for prototypical functions. The results suggest that prototypicality√Ç¬†might be determined both by mood as well as person, meaning that prototypical imperative√Ç¬†functions might be different for every person.Kokkuv√µte.

Samuti uuritakse, milline oli Taani roll Liivimaa poliitikas ning kuidas Liivimaal Taanisse suhtuti. Asjaolu, et nii Taani Riigiarhiivis kui ka teistes L‰‰nemere-‰‰rsete riikide arhiivides on Taani ja Liivimaa suhete kohta hulgaliselt seni kasutamata allikaid, annab head v√µimalused selle teema edasiseks uurimiseks.Nii Liivimaal kui ka Taanis valitsesid nendel k√ºmnenditel poliitiliselt heitlikud olud ning see m√µjutas olulisel m‰‰ral ka nendevahelisi suhteid. Olulise m√µjurina t√µuseb Liivimaa ja Taani suhetes esile Preisimaa, mille valitseja Brandenburg-Ansbachi markkrahv Albrecht otsis Taanist tuge nii Saksa Ordu k√µrgmeistri (1511&25) kui ka Preisimaa hertsogina (1525&68). Ordu Liivimaa haru suhe Taaniga oli muutlikum, sest 1525. aasta j‰rel sai Preisimaast Saksa ordu Liivimaa haru √ºks peamisi vastaseid ning seet√µttu halvenesid ka ordu suhted Taani kuningaga, kellest sai 1526. aastal Preisimaa hertsogi ‰i. Juba varem olid ordu ja teistegi liivimaalaste suhteid Taaniga komplitseerinud viimase aeg-ajalt esitatavad taotlused Eestimaa tagasisaamiseks, mida ajuti peeti ka t√µsiseks ohuks. Peale selle omandas Taani kuningas 1519.&20. aastal Kolga m√µisa, mida ta siiski pidevalt kontrollida ei suutnud ning mille valdus- ja kohtuv√µimu √ºle vaidlesid kuningas ja ordu kuni 1550. aastateni. Ordu ja Taani suhteid muutsid keeruliseks ka suhted keisriga, kuna 1523. aastal kukutatud Christian II oli Karl V √µemees ning keiser ei tunnustanud kuni 1544. aastani Taanis v√µimul olevaid kuningaid. Ordu j‰rgis keisri poliitikat ning aeg-ajalt nimetas ta Taani valitsejaid otses√µnu mittelegitiimseteks.Liivimaal oli alates 1520. aastate l√µpust ka Preisimaa-meelne leer, kes lootis toetust Taani kuningalt. Leeri olulisim esindaja oli Preisimaa hertsogi vend Wilhelm, Riia peapiiskopi koadjuutor (1529&39) ja peapiiskop (1539&63). Taani kuninga diplomaatiline tugi parandas Wilhelmi positsioone Saare-L‰‰ne vaenuse (1532&36) alguses, kui ta lootis saada sealseks piiskopiks. Taanis puhkenud Krahvivaenus (1534&36) ei v√µimaldanud Wilhelmi v‰lismaistel toetajatel teda aga olulisel m‰‰ral abistada, mist√µttu l√µppes Saare-L‰‰ne vaenus Preisimaa-meelse leeri kaotusega, ehkki Krahvivaenus oli v√µidukas just Wilhelmi toetajatele. 1544. aastal tunnustas keiser Christian III-t Taani legitiimse kuningana ning seda tegi ka Liivimaa orduharu. 1547. aastal suri Preisimaa hertsogi Taani printsessist abikaasa, misj‰rel l√µdvenesid Preisimaa ja tema toetajate sidemed Taaniga oluliselt. Seevastu paranesid ordu ja teiste liivimaalaste suhted Taaniga, n√µnda et Liivimaa s√µja alguses n‰hti kuningriiki perspektiivikaima liitlasena."

A Study of Selected Examples,https://ojs.utlib.ee/index.php/smp/article/view/22931,http://dx.doi.org/10.12697/smp.2023.10.1.03,,,"As the Peshitta plays an essential role in literary and textual criticism, the literary features of the Peshitta must be examined not only from the perspective of translation technique but also from the perspective of other factors, such as poetical devices and form. Little attention has been paid to the translation technique in the Peshitta Psalms despite the substantial research conducted on the Peshitta. Most studies have focused on the relationship between the Peshitta Psalms, the Hebrew Masoretic text, and other ancient versions. Therefore, the Peshitta Psalms have yet to be examined from the perspective of classical Syriac poetry. This study investigates how well the Syriac translator employed poetical devices to produce strophic structures and poetic style in the psalms, with particular attention to potential approaches to strophic structure that have not previously been explored. The paper addresses the question of whether the Peshitta Psalms are strophic. The study indicates that Peshitta Psalms 29, 96, 136, and 148 use strophic markers such as word repetition, alliteration, repetition of syntactical structures, parallelism and a balanced number of syllables and words."

The development of the most promising economic and administrative centre of the Kingdom of Sweden in the eastern part of the Gulf of Finland was halted as a result of the Great Northern War. However, after the bloody and destructive siege of 1704, there was a short period in which Peter I tried to highlight Narva as his victory trophy, which was to undo the disgrace of his previous defeat in the Narva battle of 1700, resulting in several construction projects (for example the house, or √¢‚Ç¨≈ìpalace√¢‚Ç¨¬ù, of the Tsar himself and the remodelling of one of the churches into the orthodox cathedral).According to the personal testimony of Domenico Trezzini, famous first architect of St Petersburg, his first work in Russia was the city gates in Narva. Letters exchanged between construction project leader Ulyan Senyavin and governor general Alexander Menshikov confirm that the √¢‚Ç¨≈ìarchitect from St Petersburg√¢‚Ç¨¬ù was heading the construction of the city gates at least in 1705. Moreover, Peter I probably personally revised the design for the sculptural programme, demanding the figure of Paul the Apostle be set above the gates. The citations of these and other relevant sources were published by the recent biographer of Trezzini Konstantin Malinovsky, attracting the attention of the author of the present paper. Partly because of misinterpretations of earlier Russian authors Malinovski did not manage to reach a conclusion as to whether it was a temporary triumphal arch in the place of the breach, or a real city gate, and if so which gate.In the Russian State Military Historical Archives in Moscow, among a full set of drawings documenting the fortifications of Narva as of 1728, i.e. shortly after the Great Northern War, there is also one sheet dedicated to the Emperor√Ç¬¥s Gate that surprises with its rich sculptural decoration. During the Swedish era the new gate designated for the same location, in between the bastions of Gloria and Honour, was to be called the King√Ç¬¥s Gate. Despite the opinion of the eminent Swedish art historian Sten Karling that this gate was built of stone before the 1704 siege, a closer look at the Swedish fortress plans (especially that of 1703 found only recently) makes it highly improbable. It is quite likely that the gate was made by Trezzini out of carved stones collected on the site before the war, which might explain the close resemblance of its architecture to the earlier Swedish fortress gates, especially Karl√Ç¬¥s Gate in Riga. The Emperor√Ç¬¥s Gate on its own became the prototype for Peter√Ç¬¥s Gate at the Peter and Paul Fortress in St Petersburg, as Peter I himself ordered it to be made √¢‚Ç¨≈ìresembling the one in Narva√¢‚Ç¨¬ù, although the gate itself was throned by St Peter, another of Peter I spiritual patrons. Trezzini, as is now clear, took over almost all the sculptural d√É¬©cor from Narva, expanding on it. The symbolic meanings of the statuary, here only covered at the most basic level, are ripe for further discussion."

Mosses are good indicators of air pollution. In Estonia, heavy metals have been measured fromPleurozium schreberiandHylocomium splendens, which do not grow in areas of Tallinn with a higher pollution load. In the present study, Cu, Fe and Cd were measured from five moss species growing in contaminated as well less polluted areas of Tallinn. Based on stationary and street pollution source inventory and air pollution dispersion modelling, the long-term average concentrations of fine particles (PM10) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) in air were estimated. The work revealed that it is possible to find a moss species that is common in Tallinn and grows in both polluted and less polluted areas &Syntrichia ruralis, which is the most suitable species for bioindication based on this work. Moss speciesCeratodon purpureusaccumulated the most Cd, Cu, and Fe, thenBrachytheciumrutabulum/Sciuro-hypnum curtum, andRhytidiadelphus squarrosusthe least. Statistically significant higher Fe concentrations were in theSyntrichia ruralis, compared to theSciuro-hypnum curtumandRhytidiadelphus squarrosus. TheSyntrichia ruralisalso had significantly higher Cd content compared to theBrachythecium rutabulum/Sciuro-hypnum curtum. The results of the GLM analysis showed that the content of various heavy metals depends on the moss species and the degree of fine particles in the environment, and it didn't depend on whether the moss grows on the soil or a hard substrate such as concrete, stone or asphalt."

In order for all of this to work, the customs officer must be qualified and professionally competent. The competence requirements are developed internally within the institutions and can be used as a basis for the development of professional qualification requirements and, subsequently, professional standards.
The purpose of this study was to provide preliminary insigt into the current situation of ensuring and developing the competence of customs officials in Estonia and in the European Union and to identify its further development needs, including the need for drafting and implementing a professional standard. For this purpose, the existence of professional standards for customs officials in the European Union countries, relevant scientific literature and legislation, and the views of the Estonian Tax and Customs Board (TCB) on the importance of a qualified workforce were analyzed. The analysis revealed that no professional standard for customs officers has been drawn up in any of the EU countries, however, in seven countries, in the interest of the private sector, professional standards have been drawn up for the benefit of those involved in customs operations. The TCB has not yet considered it necessary to discuss the applicability of the professional standards but considers it important in the operation of customs policy to have a qualified workforce. Educational institutions in the EU Member States of the International Network of Customs Universities (INCU) declare that they teach customs officers in curricula that meet the competency requirements of the World Customs Organization customs officers."

It is expected that there will be 50 artificial-intelligence applications operating in Estonian public administration by the end of 2020. The machine learning capacity that is often intrinsic in artificial intelligence systems means, in practice, that even the data analyst or programmer who wrote the respective code is later no longer able to explain the parameters behind the decisions. If the state allows a so-called black box to make administrative decisions, further constitutional issues will arise in addition to that of judicial control of such a decision. An administrative decision presumes the implementation of legislation. Owing to the vagueness of the law, a judicial appraisal does not merely involve formal-logic operations, as laws and regulations require interpretation and the consideration of the facts. This is particularly important in making discretionary decisions. Interpretation and consideration must not be limited to the predictions made on the basis of earlier, similar cases by means of statistical methods. It is not rare that a decision on applying a standard needs to be made also in a situation that the legislator has been unable to foresee and for which there is no requisite pattern emerging in the training data fed to an algorithm. The article examines the related principles arising from the Constitution, and one of the conclusions drawn from these is that for factually or legally complex decisions, the weight of the decision must be borne by humans, at least until much more powerful artificial intelligence is developed. However, with the help of learning algorithms individual components and elements of such decisions can be taken. Full automation remains an option in cases of routine administrative decisions that are advantageous for the person(s) concerned and that lack negative side effects for them, as well in cases where all relevant factual circumstances are comprehensible to an algorithm as such and transparent."

The reason for this lack of researchinto wooden architecture are manifold but can most easily beassociated with socially complex relationships and previous researchmethods, resulting in the only monograph to date, Gustav R‰nk'sDie‰lteren baltischen Herrenh√∂fe in Estland(1971), which analysed woodenarchitecture in the 17th century, known in Estonia as the Swedishperiod. Since it is generally accepted that previous classificationsof wooden architecture do not allow for great conclusions, the aimof this article is to give an overview of the architectural genesis ofwooden manor houses during the manorial √¢‚Ç¨Àúgolden era', asking howmodern ideas made their way into local architecture. In this regard,this paper also deals with architectural treatises and handbooks fromthe 18th and early decades of the 19th centuries and the question ofthe adaptation of architectural theorists' ideas to local architecture.The genesis of Estonian wooden manorial architecture can bedivided into three distinguished periods that are similar to the overalldevelopment of manorial architecture in the Baltics. Although thevery first wooden noble residences built at the beginning of the 18thcentury were small urbaltisch buildings with a central chimney thatresembled those built in the Swedish era, newer architectural formsmore in touch with the architectural trends of the time appearedon lands that had either escaped the negative consequences of theGreat Northern War and plague or had been donated by the Russianrulers. In other places, manorial architecture continued with thetraditions, which began to change more strongly in the second half ofthe century, reflecting the landlords' greater need for representativepurposes. This not only brought changes to construction techniquesbut also to the buildings' overall appearance: most wooden dwellingsdoubled in size and were decorated according to late Baroque orearly Neoclassical elements. More major changes took place in thefirst decades of the 19th century, which gave contemporaries a chanceto describe wooden dwellings as √¢‚Ç¨Àúlight and summery', testifying tochanges in building traditions.Since at this stage of research only a handful of building masters,masons and construction carpenters are known to have worked inthe building of wooden manor houses, this article suggests that thelandlords may also have drawn the ground plans themselves, with thehelp of architectural treatises and handbooks of the time. Althoughthe architectural ideas of Nikolaus Goldmann, Friedrich ChristianSchmidt and David Gilly are tangible, it is possible that in manycases the influence was more indirect and depended on the generalstylistic and technical changes of the period. This architecturalconservativism can partly be explained by the fact that Baltic manorslargely depended on local craftsmen and peasants from nearbyvillages, but also by the nobility's general aversion to all things new.A much more accessible treatise for many noblemen at the time mayhave been the economic handbook written by local pastor AugustWilhelm Hupel, which included some thoughts on the buildingprocess; however, since he did not introduce any new architecturalideas, but rather carried on with the local traditions, it is possiblethat his ideas were put to practice elsewhere, where landlords didnot actively live. The same conclusion can be drawn about thestandardised model fa√É¬ßade projects, which made certain fa√É¬ßadescompulsory for cities in the Russian Empire in the early decadesof the 19th century, but had very little effect on Estonian woodenmanor houses.Although this article brings clarity to many aspects of woodenmanorial architecture, the most important contribution to the historyof Baltic manorial architecture is bringing attention to the fact thatwood as a building material was not only widespread but held adominant role in building practice. This not only emphasises Balticmanorial architecture's peripheral role on the map of European art,but also creates new perspectives to delve deeper into the connectionswith Scandinavia and other countries, where the material played apart in the building practices of the higher and lower strata of society."

The ring-widthseries of the door was most similar to oak chronology from theDaugava River. However, this does not mean that the door timbersoriginate from that region.

This shows that Estonian ICT firms adapted quickly to seize the opportunities brought by the pandemic to retain their competitiveness. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to investigate the characteristics (size, ownership and export intensity) of the Estonian firms. The study also contributes to the EU√Ç¬¥s objective to promote greater transparency on service traders (European Commission, 2021), as we provide new information for policy-makers and support the Estonian and European digital agendas (Estonia, 2018; European Commission, 2020, 2021).

Annetamise protsessi ja dokumentide algset t‰hendust aitab osaliselt rekonstrueerida √ºrikute s√µnastuse ja kirjutajate t√∂√∂ uurimine, privileegide hilisemal t√µlgendamisel on aga abiks √ºrikute hiliskeskaegsed ja varauusaegsed koopiad ja t√µlked.Alates Friedrich Georg von Bungest on uurijad pidanud L√ºbecki √µiguse Tallinnale annetamise alusdokumendiks Taani kuninga Erik Plovpenningi √ºrikut 15. maist 1248, milles Tallinna kodanikele lubati L√ºbecki kodanikega samu √µigusi. V√µimalik, et see ei t‰hendanud veel L√ºbecki √µigust, vaid lihtsalt √µigust linna elama asuda ja seal majandada. Selges√µnaliselt lubab L√ºbecki √µigust (ius lubicense) Tallinnal kasutada alles kuningas Christoffer I √ºrik 1255. aastast. 1248. aasta √ºrikut hakkas Tallinna raad esitlema L√ºbecki √µiguse esma-annetamisaktina alles Rootsi ajal, kui keskv√µim p√º√ºdis linna autonoomiat k‰rpida, raad aga √ºritas t√µendada oma √µigust iseseisvatele otsustele v√µimalikult vana dokumendiga.1248. aasta √ºrik ei ole originaalis s‰ilinud. Selle tekst on tuntud Saksa ordu provintsiaali Burchard von Dreylebeni 1347. aastal kinnitatud transsumpti kaudu, mis sisaldab kokku 27 olulisema Tallinnale annetatud taaniaegse √ºriku ‰rakirja. Enamik neist √ºrikutest on s‰ilinud ka originaalis. Transsumpti on kirja pannud Tallinna raekirjutaja ning v√µib arvata, et kopeeritavad √ºrikudki valis v‰lja nimelt raad ja mitte orduprovintsiaal. Sama kirjutaja k‰ega on lisaks arvukatele Tallinna raedokumentidele kirja pandud ka n‰iteks Saksa ordu Liivimaa k‰sknike, Rootsi kuninglike ametnike Soomes, Tallinna dominiiklaste ja tsistertslaste kloostri jt nimel v‰ljastatud dokumente, kui neis on puudutatud Tallinna. Niisiis oli kirjutajal mitme eri v√µimukandja ja institutsiooni usaldus, ta oli h‰sti informeeritud erinevates administratiivsetes ja poliitilistes k√ºsimustes ning tundis muu hulgas suurep‰raselt Taani v√µimu ordule √ºleandmise asjaolusid P√µhja-Eestis.Rakvere sai Taani kuningalt privileegid 1302. ja 1345. aastal, Narva 1345. aastal. Nii Rakverel kui ka Narval lubati kasutada tallinlastega v√µrdseid √µigusi. Nagu vanim Tallinna privileegi√ºrik, nii ei ole ka neist kolmest dokumendist √ºkski originaalis s‰ilinud. 1345. aastal Rakverele ja Narvale v‰ljastatud √ºrikute kirjapanijaks v√µis olla kuningas Valdemar IV saadiku Stig Anderssoni sekret‰r, kelle k‰tt kohtab mitmetes teistes saadiku v‰ljastatud √ºrikutes. Kuna 1345. aasta √ºrikus Narvale (nagu ka Rakverele) mainitakse kuningas Eriku aegseid √µigusi, on osa uurijaid arvanud, et algselt sai Narva privileegid Erik Menvedi valitsemisajal, kuigi √ºhtki teist dokumenti peale 1345. aasta √ºriku selle kinnituseks ei ole. V√µimalik, et kuningas Eriku nimi on Narva √ºrikusse sattunud seet√µttu, et √ºriku kirjapanija kasutas osaliselt eeskujuna varem samal aastal Rakverele v‰ljastatud √ºriku teksti, mille koostaja v√µis olla tema ise. Algse kirjutaja, samuti hilisemate ‰rakirjade valmistajate ja t√µlkijate kasutatud s√µnastus ja eeskujud v√µivad olla m√µjutanud ka teiste privileegi√ºrikute uusaegset t√µlgendust.√úldjoontes kujunes taaniaegse P√µhja-Eesti linnade √µiguslik seisund, mis v√µimaldas L√ºbecki √µiguse kasutamist ja apellatsiooni√µigust L√ºbeckisse v√µi m√µnda teise L√ºbecki √µiguse linna, sama mustri alusel, nagu Taani v√µimu alla kuulunud Saksa aladel. Nagu Saksamaal, nii ka Eestis v√µis k√ºllaltki oluline osa selles olla linnade endi algatusel."

Until now, Estonian researchers have resorted to conceptualizing place-lore from the perspective of archival texts, and the focus has been on collecting and archiving the material. At the same time, theoretical study of place-lore has remained in the background. In the article I approach place-lore from the perspective of ecosemiotics and suggest a new definition of place-lore that is based on semiotic relations these narratives have with the environment they represent. Outlining different ways of how vernacular tradition and the environment it represents are semiotically related, and analysing the ways in which these relations are expressed in place-related folklore allows seeing how place-lore can be defined through (1) localizability, (2) representation of the characteristics of a place, and (3) manifestation of place experience. Defining place-lore and presenting the preliminary conceptual tools is much needed in practical collection work and archiving and serves as an important prerequisite for studying the placerelated folklore in the context of contemporary challenges, such as changing textual practices, cultural disruptions, and environmental crisis. Examples are drawn from folklore associated with mires, specifically from narratives about the Kakerdaja Bog in northern Estonia."

In this article, some aspectsof these colour schemes are discussed. Firstly, the question of thedecoration and redecoration of interiors during the Middle Ages isaddressed, secondly the authorship and technique of vernacularlookingmurals is discussed, and thirdly the geographical spreadof these decorations is analysed. In addition, post-medieval muralsare also examined.This article is based on fieldwork in Estonian medieval churchesconducted over a period of fifteen years by the staff and studentsof the Department of Conservation and Cultural Heritage at theEstonian Academy of Arts. Here mainly the results of work in thechurches at Koeru, Keila and J‰rva-Jaani is presented. Some otherchurches are also discussed for comparison.So far, medieval painted decoration has been found in around25 church interiors on the territory of present-day Estonia, i.e. inroughly a quarter of the medieval churches. Although the numberis not large, the finds allow us to draw some conclusions regardingthe spread of and networks behind these paintings.We can claim that as elsewhere in medieval (northern) Europe,medieval church interiors included at least some kind of painteddecoration. It seems likely that the first (and possibly in many casesthe only) colour scheme was provided by the builders. Especiallyin rural parishes, where no specialised guilds existed, it mighthave been difficult to employ professional painters, although notimpossible. Almost certainly the decoration was applied at the timeof plastering, when the mortar had not yet set and the scaffoldingwas still available.Historical records, surviving artworks and investigated interiorsdemonstrate that after the Reformation the Lutherans were less radical in transforming churches than were other Protestants: severalCatholic altar retables and statues were preserved, side altars werenot removed, etc. The churches were usually decorated with new,more modern murals and only whitewashed in many cases severalcenturies later.Gradually, church interiors became more monochrome, althoughnot necessarily white, something that has been associated with thespread of Pietistic ideas in the Lutheran church. However, the late 19thcentury brought a revival of colour to at least some churches. Thesecolourful, mainly Gothic revival interiors survived for only a shorttime and disappeared again when they were painted over everywhere.For example, in St Lawrence's in Kuusalu, wall paintings dating fromthe period of the Gothic revival renovation of the medieval church(1899) were found and uncovered in 2021."

As a rule, discussion of Yiddish in the region is mostly based√Ç¬†on the classical descriptions of the Yiddish varieties from the beginning of the 20th√Ç¬†century. It is demonstrated that common features in phonology and lexicon of Courland√Ç¬†(and Estonian) Yiddish and Baltic German are, in fact, regional and attested at least in√Ç¬†varieties of Estonian but often in Latvian and Livonian as well.

In the 20th century, multilingual√Ç¬†speech was a norm at least among Estonian Jews, and, based on fieldwork data from the√Ç¬†1990s among multilingual Estonian Jews, there is no clear preference of insertional or√Ç¬†alternational code-switching.

The article seeks to answer why portrayal of the feeling of malaise and low spirits were so widespread from the beginning of the 20thcentury, and how Estonian artists imagined and visualised melancholia.I argue, that during the period under examination, increasing attention was paid in Estonia to mental health issues, including melancholia, which was brought about by discussions about breed and the surfacing ideas of eugenics and the study of heredity. At the same time, degeneration theories began to gain ground, according to which contemporary civilisation was bound to degrade, and an increase in mental problems was seen as a sign of that degradation in addition to various social and cultural processes. In addition, Estonian artists were influenced (directly or indirectly) by foreign artworks, literature and poetry that deal with the tragical and horrific side of humanity, such as mental health issues. I argue that artists depicted melancholia in a symbolic manner mainly through body language and body parts, but that the condition was also conveyed through the use of natural imagery and colour."

As a result of the crumbling of great empires, new states emerged in north-eastern and eastern Europe along with corresponding new autocephalous and autonomous Orthodox churches. This article analyses the changes in Estonian ecclesiastical life in the context of the centralization policies in the late 19th century Russian Empire (i.e., Russification) and the dissolution of tsarist rule at the start of the 20th century. Particular attention is devoted to the activity of the Estonian Orthodox community in connection with the establishment of Estonian statehood in 1918, which in the 1920s gave rise to the Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church. The events are placed in the context of similar processes in south-eastern Europe, with a focus laid on Estonian historiography while also examining the Russian approach to history, which continues to be rooted in the imperial tradition."

Several notable scholars have stressed that meaning is created through the interaction between reader and text, highlighting the significance of the reader. Even though the main principles of reader-response have become commonplace, for some time, reading theories remained relatively stagnant. In the 2000s, however, the topic of reading was rediscovered as new perspectives for examining the reading experience and the reader's relationship with the text were offered. These new theories shed new light on the figure of the reader and on the work that goes into the process of reading. While the question of the experience of reading has been under discussion in the Anglo-American context, it has never been widely discussed in Estonia. The purpose of this article is to give an overview of well-known reader-response theories that became popular in the 1970s. In addition, examples of a renewed interest in reader-response theories in recent decades are presented.

Outside of cellular biology attempts have been made in both (text)linguistics and semiotics to describe the genome and its interactions as similar to language. However, the approach of this interpretation relies particularly on the poetic function of language and its underlying self-referentiality as the starting point. Poetic relevance reveals itself explicitly in its relationship to the cutting-edge concept of CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats), which thematises abundant metric and figurative phenomena and terms on several levels: accumulation, regularity, interval, different repetitions, rhythm, iamb/trochee, stressed/unstressed units, longitude, orchestration; equivalency, substitution, connotation, contrast, analogy; synecdoche, metonymy, metaphor, irony, symbol, paradox, implicature, epithet, simile; palindrome, chiasmus, ellipsis, zeugma, calembour, polysyndeton; poem, verse, stanza, chapter, refrain, (identical) rhyme, collage/bricolage, plot, composition, text, hypertext, architext, palimpsest; graphic imagery, symmetry/asymmetry; homonyms, synonyms, antonyms, archaisms, neologisms; words, phrases, sentences, syntax, definition, quote; cacophony/noise, harmony; spatial and time deixis; self-reflexivity of the utterance and utterer. From this perspective, life stems from primordial poetics as the first level. It is a convincing enough association to apply poetic analysis to the free interpretation process of genomes. A universal law of nature is that symmetry dictates design (including asymmetry): poetics is everywhere."

The paper argues that changes in thedepiction of the leaders amounted to the fundamental meaning and message of these works ofart. Especially from the end of the 1960s, an increasingly playful and ironic undertoneprevailed.In using the depictions of the Soviet leaders in Estonian art to test the aforementionedtheoretical constructions, the paper however concludes that changes in the official discoursein Estonian arts did not wholly conform to the performative shift as described by Yurchak."

The governing equation for the longitudinal vibrations of the rod was solved using the Haar wavelet integration method. The calculated natural frequency parameters closely aligned with those available in the literature. The normalised values of the first ten natural frequency parameters were used in the feature vector to predict the stiffness parameter of the springs. A feedforward neural network with two hidden layers made accurate predictions when the range of each natural frequency parameterwithin its domain exceeded one. The insights garnered from this study contribute to the design, optimisation and assessment of diverse engineering applications."

Eringen's nonlocal theory of elasticity is used for the determination of critical buckling load for stepped nanobeams subjected to axial loads for different support conditions. An analytical approach to study the impact of discontinuities and boundary conditions on the critical buckling load and critical stress of nanobeams has been developed. Critical buckling loads of stepped nanobeams are defined under the condition that the nanoelements are weakened with stable crack-like defects. Simply supported, clamped and cantilever nanobeams with steps and cracks are investigated in this article. The presented results are compared with the other available results and are found to be in a close agreement."

For most of these species, it was the second Red List assessment using the IUCN system (the first such evaluation was performed in 2008). The main data sources for species occurrence were the records reported in 100 study sites located throughout the country during 2020, and the PlutoF biodiversity database. 125 species remained, according to the new assessment, in the category Least Concern (LC) and their populations are not under threat in Estonia at present. Two species were placed in the category Not Applicable (NA) because of systematic revisions while 33 species were assigned to the categories Endangered (EN), Vulnerable (VU) or Near Threatened (NT); one further species received the status Data Deficient (DD). Thus, the threat status has changed for 22% of the studied species that had generally been considered common in Estonia. The reasons for this change are variable but there is clear evidence that 26 species have become more threatened during last 12 years."

The new Digital Content Directive and Sales of Goods Directive create a legal presumption that the seller of smart goods is contractually liable not only for the tangible item and embedded digital software but also for the inter-connected digital services. However, the article shows that much room remains for party autonomy as express agreement in a sales contract may limit the liability of the seller even for the operating system of smart goods and, thereby, override reasonable consumer expectations. The situation becomes even more complicated when the √¢‚Ç¨Àúdigital element' of the goods consists of free and open-source software: in these cases, the √¢‚Ç¨Àúseparately bought' digital content does not even fall within the scope of the Digital Content Directive, with the result that the seller is not liable for the digital content under the Sales of Goods Directive and the digital content provider is not liable for it under the Digital Content Directive. Therefore, the article argues that the new contract-law package does not raise the level of consumer protection in respect of smart goods as much as it might initially seem to."

Using this theoretical model allows for an investigation into the paradoxical nature of reality and hyperreality, which is a novel approach to understanding how a user co-develops with both their physical and immersive virtual environments. Analysis for the four degrees of nature within the virtual space reveals that an immersive virtual environment emerges from an imaginative void, contains milieu that users can recognize and interact with, offers the action-potentiality (affordances) for altering and changing materials within the virtual space, and the reproductive nature which converges the boundaries of reality and hyperreality during the meaning-making process for users. Additionally, this paper elaborates how technological household goods in the past century have integrated texts into the cultural construct of a home. The paper identifies how immersive virtual environments alter an inhabitant's perception and interactions within the home and explains how to model immersion, which is important for future research of user behaviour in the digital age of new media."

The results contribute to several open questions concerning the acoustic correlates of word stress: Does fixed word stress have acoustic correlates? Can duration be the primary acoustic correlate of word stress in a language with contrastive segment length? Is F0 an exclusive correlate of phrase stress or does it also correlate with word stress? The study finds that despite being fixed, Estonian word stress significantly correlates with acoustic features. The primary correlate is F0, followed by vowel quality, overall intensity, duration and spectral tilt. The results support the functional load hypothesis which predicts that duration is not the primary acoustic correlate of word stress in languages with contrastive segment length. The results do not support the assumption that F0 exclusively correlates with phrasal stress and intonational pitch accents.Kokkuvo√å∆íte.

The tongue movement of 24 Russian L1 and 21 Estonian L1 speakers were recorded with an electromagnetic articulograph. The speakers articulated phonologically contrastive word pairs andi-stemmed nouns where the final consonant was palatalized. Previous research has shown that palatalization is generally realized by raising the tongue dorsum towards the hard palate. Consequently, the tongue becomes more anterior and wider. This rising of the tongue also lengthens the duration of the segments. The results showed that Russian L1 speakers' tongue dorsum was higher and more anterior when palatalizing consonants and the subsequent vowels. Compared to native speakers, their tongue was retracted and lower. Russian L1 speakers' duration of palatalized consonants and the vowels that preceded them were significantly shorter than in the control group. They did not use duration to differentiate palatalization in word pairs as native speakers do.Kokkuv√µte.Anton Malmi, P‰rtel Lippus, Einar Meister: Vene emakeelega k√µnelejate Eesti palatalisatsiooni artikulatoorsed ja temporaalsed tunnused.Artiklis uuritakse, kuidas vene emakeelega k√µnelejad h‰‰ldavad eesti keele palatalisatsiooni.

But another question could be added to this inquiry: what is the origin, the genesis of organisms and their environments which are now to be indivisibly united once again? On the basis of the transactional conception of relations proposed by John Dewey, the concept of schismogenesis as described by Gregory Bateson, and the process of individuation as explicated by Gilbert Simondon, it is proposed that it is the umwelt which is ontologically primary, and that it is its internal division, separation and individuation, which results in the appearance of organisms with their environments."

The main focus of the article is on vernacular religion as a concept and methodology, introduced by Leonard N. Primiano in the 1990s, which opened up a new perspective in the study of religions. The article considers √¢‚Ç¨Àúvernacular' as a flexible concept, instrumental in developing folkloristics in its trans-disciplinary dialogues. Projected on the history of folkloristics as a multilingual field of studies with roots in multiple national, regional and ethnic traditions, vernacular as an outlook enables us to think of folklore as a transcultural concept and disconnect it from colonial legacies."

Further analysis was conducted by using a taxonomic approach (Ragin 2011). The lack of national regulation with an insufficient understanding of social work has affected the local governments‚Äü ability to choose the best of the available opinions. An agreement has been missing as to how the local government shares responsibility with the State and the families. In the current situation, the responsibilities of each of the parties are not specified. The situation is unclear- who is actually the client of the rural local government? The local-centered approach makes the local government‚Äüs social work practice politically loaded. In the future, however, the model of an independent professional social worker and of the recipient being the most important participant of the service provider system should prevail."

This study explores a method that derives DT by using satellite altimetry (SA) in conjunction with a high-resolution marine geoid model. To assess the method, DT was computed using along-track SA from Sentinel- 3A (S3A), Sentinel-3B (S3B), and Jason-3 (JA3), then compared with DT derived from a tide-gauge-corrected hydrodynamic model (HDM) for the period 2017&2019 over the Baltic Sea. Comparison of SA-derived DT and corrected HDM showed average discrepancies in the range of √Ç¬±20 cm, with root mean square errors of 9 cm (for S3B) and 6 cm (for S3A and JA6) and a standard deviation between 2 and 16 cm. Inter-comparisons between data sources and multi-mission SA over the Baltic Sea also potentially identified certain persistent and semi-persistent problematic areas that are either associated with deficiencies in the geoid, tide gauge, HDM, and SA or a combination of all of these. In addition, it was observed that SA data have the potential to show a more realistic (detailed) variation of DT compared to HDM, which tended to generate only a smooth (low-pass) surface and underestimate DT."

The growing quantity of online open data provide new opportunities for assimilation algorithms to improve ambient air quality monitoring, including estimates of their uncertainty. The assimilation of large-scale numerical simulations with observations from urban ambient air quality monitoring stations requires uncertainty estimates from both data sources to cope with unknown events and changing environmental conditions. However, uncertainty estimates from open access numerical models and monitoring stations are frequently unavailable. To address this gap, we propose a lightweight data-driven framework for data assimilation on low-powered embedded hardware suitable for open data without uncertainty estimates, including Internet of Things (IoT) systems. The algorithms are compared and validated using open data from a reference ambient air quality monitoring station during two time periods, the first in fall (October to November) and the second in winter (January to February). Open numerical model data were obtained during these periods from the System for Integrated modeLing of Atmospheric coMposition (SILAM). The algorithms are also demonstrated on two IoT sensors located 60√Ç¬†m and 700√Ç¬†m from the reference station. This work is significant because it offers a computationally lightweight approach to sequentially assimilate station, sensor, and numerical simulation data that do not have prior uncertainty estimates. The proposed method can be applied to impute missing data, to improve the reporting accuracy of air quality observations, and to provide missing uncertainty estimates."

The widely used DRASTIC method has been modified to improve groundwater vulnerability assessment in regions where Quaternary sediments form a confining layer above the main useful aquifer. This study applied the modified DRASTIC method to two study areas in Estonia with heterogenous Quaternary sediments. The results were compared to the original DRASTIC method and a groundwater vulnerability assessment method used formerly in Estonia. The results significantly improved with the modified version compared to the original method. The modified method also exhibited stronger correlations with nitrate concentration data, illustrating the higher accuracy of the modified DRASTIC method in vulnerability assessment in regions with confined aquifers. The results highlight the significance of modifying the vulnerability assessment methods according to regional geological conditions to evaluate groundwater vulnerability accurately and support informed decision-making in groundwater management and protection."

Intricate porous metallic structures, such as lattices, scaffolds, or triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMSs), created via the selective laser melting (SLM) technique, are utilized as load-bearing matrices for filled ceramics. The primary metal alloys in this category are titanium-based Ti6Al4V and iron-based 316L, which can have either a uniform cell or a gradient structure. Well-known ceramics used in biomaterial applications include titanium dioxide (TiO2), zirconium dioxide (ZrO2), aluminum oxide (Al2O3), hydroxyapatite (HA), wollastonite (W), and tricalcium phosphate (TCP). To fill the structures fabricated by SLM, an appropriate ceramic is employed through the spark plasma sintering (SPS) method, making them suitable for in vitro or in vivo applications following minor post-processing. The combined SLM-SPS approach offers advantages, such as rapid design and prototyping, as well as assured densification and consolidation, although challenges persist in terms of large-scale structure and molding design. The individual or combined application of SLM and SPS processes can be implemented based on the specific requirements for fabricated sample size, shape complexity, densification, and mass productivity. This flexibility is a notable advantage offered by the combined processes of SLM and SPS. The present article provides an overview of metal&ceramic composites produced through SLM-SPS techniques. Mg-W-HA demonstrates promise for load-bearing biomedical applications, while Cu-TiO2-Ag exhibits potential for virucidal activities. Moreover, a functionally graded lattice (FGL) structure, either in radial or longitudinal directions, offers enhanced advantages by allowing adjustability and control over porosity, roughness, strength, and material proportions within the composite."

The Estonian oil shale (OS) sector is an example where such solutions are more than welcome. The combustion of OS generates a continuous flow of ashes destined to landfills. In this study, the technical feasibility of producing monolith building materials incorporating different OS ashes from Estonia was evaluated. Three binder systems were studied: self-cementation of the ashes, ceramic sintering in clay brick production and accelerated carbonation of OS ash (OSA) compacts. Results showed that most of the OSAs studied have low self-cementitious properties and these properties were affected by ash fineness and mineralogical composition. In case of clay bricks, OSA addition resulted in a higher porosity and improved insulation properties. The carbonated OSA compacts showed promising compressive strength. Accelerated carbonation of compacted samples was found to be the most promising way for the future utilization of OSAs as sustainable zero-waste and carbon neutral solution."

This paper attempts to give the reader an overview of the existing research and thermal solutions which have been realized with the use of AM. These include novel heat sink and heat exchanger designs, solutions for cooling the machine windings directly, and additively manufactured hollow windings. Some solutions such as heat pipes, which have been produced with AM but not used to cool electrical machines, are also discussed, as these are used in conventional designs and will certainly be used for additively manufactured electrical machines in the future."

In this work, a full E-type transformer core is printed, characterized, and compared in terms of performance with a conventional Goss textured core. For facilitating a modular winding and eddy current loss reduction, the 3D printed core is assembled from four novel interlocking components, which structurally imitate the E-type core laminations. Both cores are compared at approximately their respective optimal working conditions, at identical magnetizing currents. Due to the superior magnetic properties of the Goss sheet conventional transformer core, 10% reduced efficiency (from 80.5% to 70.1%) and 34% lower power density (from 59 VA/kg to 39 VA/kg) of the printed transformer are identified at operating temperature. The first prototype transformer core demonstrates the state of the art and initial optimization step for further development of additively manufactured soft ferromagnetic components. Further optimization of both the 3D printed material and core design are proposed for obtaining higher electrical performance for AC applications."

The case of Estonia, as an example of a twin (digital and green) transition, is examined. We explored Estonian entrepreneurs' perceptions of challenges and opportunities related to the green transition. The data were collected via an online survey from 532 Estonian companies, focus groups, and individual semi-structured interviews with 42 experts. Survey data were analyzed using proportional odds logistic regression, and interview data were examined using thematic analysis. Based on the interview findings, the main perceived entrepreneurial opportunities related to green transitions were increasing production efficiency and favoring taxation for green products and services. The main challenges included losing competitive advantage, coping with crises, and the need for long-term planning and significant investments. Survey findings revealed that too much pressure only from politicians and a lack of innovation might increase the likelihood of perceived company cost increases. More pressure from other stakeholders and increased innovation were associated with higher odds of viewing the green transition as an opportunity. This study provides valuable insights into the perceptions of Estonian entrepreneurs regarding the challenges and opportunities of the green transition and contributes to their categorization."

The measurements were conducted during 2016&2018. The total number of measurement points was 100, and the duration of individual time series varied. According to the results, the mean air pressure difference was within the range of national recommendations (small underpressure indoors) in 81&89% of measurement points, but some cases experienced either strong underpressure or overpressure conditions. In some cases, the air pressure difference showed a clear stepwise constant behavior, while other cases showed larger temporal variation. The conditions varied between different operating situations and the time of year. The study also supports the current recommendation that air pressure difference measurements should be done as continuous measurements of at least one week duration."

Albania wants to lead in waste-to-energy conversion exploration by focusing on trash minimization, reuse, recycling, and energy generation from residual waste. Although there has been notable advancement, especially in aligning laws with EU requirements, there are practical obstacles, especially in the execution of waste-to-energy projects. The challenges involve the need for effective waste segregation, higher recycling rates, and the use of advanced waste-to-energy technologies.

Improved condition monitoring methods are required for greater visibility of insulation defects in the cable networks. One of the critical challenges for continuous monitoring is the large amount of partial discharge (PD) data that poses constraints on the diagnostic capabilities. This paper presents the performance comparison of two data acquisition techniques based on phase resolved partial discharge (PRPD) and pulse acquisition (PA). The major contribution of this work is to provide an in-depth understanding of these techniques considering the perspective of randomness of the PD mechanism and improvements in the reliability of diagnostics. Experimental study is performed on the medium voltage (MV) cables in the laboratory environment. It has been observed that PRPD based acquisition not only requires a significantly larger amount of data but is also susceptible to losing the important information especially when multiple PD sources are being investigated. On the other hand, the PA technique presents improved performance for PD diagnosis. Furthermore, the use of the PA technique enables the efficient practical implementation of the continuous PD monitoring by reducing the amount of data that is acquired by extracting useful signals and discarding the silent data intervals."

This study aims to help develop nutritionally adequate, health-promoting, and culturally acceptable dietary guidelines at an affordable price. Three food baskets (FBs) were optimised using linear programming to meet recommended nutrient intakes (RNIs), or Estonian dietary guidelines, or both. In total, 6255 prices of 422 foods were collected. The Estonian National Dietary Survey (ENDS) provided a proxy for cultural acceptability. Food baskets for a family of four, earning minimum wage, contain between 73 and 96 foods and cost between 10.66 and 10.92 EUR per day. The nutritionally adequate FB that does not follow Estonian dietary guidelines deviates the least (26% on average) from ENDS but contains twice the sugar, sweets, and savoury snacks recommended. The health-promoting FB (40% deviation) contains a limited amount of sugar, sweets, and savoury snacks. However, values for vitamin D, iodine, iron, and folate are low compared with RNIs, as is calcium for women of reproductive age. When both the RNIs and dietary guidelines are enforced, the average deviation (73%) and cost (10.92 EUR) are highest. The composition of these FBs can help guide the development of dietary guidelines for low income families in Estonia."

Students with more advanced executive control to resist distraction (Rutherford et al., 2018) have greater success with the SDL approach, while learners with weaker executive skills get more easily captured by automatic or √¢‚Ç¨≈ìcompeting√¢‚Ç¨¬ù responses when trying to retain the relevant information (Engle, 2018, p. 191). For example, poor impulse control leads to difficulties in generating or implementing proper strategies, which causes problems with planning, regulating, and monitoring one's performance and reduced working memory (Anderson, 2002, p. 72). Nonetheless, despite the learner's capability, the SDL-specific reasoning in order to reach a relevant conclusion (to make sense and relate the material to be memorized) requires skills 1) at the single object level and at the 2) overall meta level (De Bruin and van Merri√É¬´nboer, 2017). This kind of complexity increases one's cognitive load (Janssen et al., 2010) that can hamper attention control (Best and Miller, 2010;Ecker et al., 2010) to keep the focus (Engle, 2018) in multiple switching between one's mental tasks (Miyake and Friedman, 2012).

The strengths and weaknesses of the blended and active learning combination are evaluated from didactic and methodological sides. It shows a fundamentally different approach to learning from students belonging to various degree programs. Most of the bachelor degree learners volunteered to participate in active learning, although a significant proportion of them was unable to succeed. In contrast, the learning of master students looks more circumspect and selective; they devote less time to study, but spend it more wisely, being more highly responsible for the outcomes than bachelors. The EuroTeQ participants did not push on many active learning activities, but demonstrated quite high motivation in quizzes, labs, and online consultations.

It is regulated by several anti-angiogenic molecules involved in tumor growth and metastasis. The endothelial angiopoietin Ang-Tie/PI3K/AKT growth receptor pathway is necessary for healthy vascular development. The activation of AKT is controlled by a multistep process involving phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). This article aims to provide an overview of the role and mechanism of the Ang-Tie/PI3K/AKT signaling pathways and the potential of flavonoids as anti-angiogenic drugs. Flavonoids have shown great potential in preventing angiogenesis by targeting signaling pathways and exhibit additional anti-cancer properties. Research studies have revealed that the currently available anti-angiogenic drugs do not meet the safety and efficacy standards for treating tumor growth. Phytocompounds have long been a valuable resource for the development of novel therapeutic drugs. This article explores recent findings explaining the role and mechanism of the Ang-Tie/PI3K/AKT signaling pathways, as well as the interaction of flavonoids with angiogenic signaling pathways as a novel therapeutic approach. Several investigations have shown that synergistic studies of natural phytocompounds have great potential to target these pathways to inhibit tumor growth. Therefore, flavonoid-based medications may offer a more effective synergistic strategy to treat cancer."

Degradation and mineralization of glycopeptide antibiotic vancomycin (VMN) were examined by UV photolysis, pulsed corona discharge (PCD), and their combinations with extrinsic oxidants, hydrogen peroxide (HP), peroxydisulfate (PDS), and peroxymonosulfate (PMS). Both combinations were effective in VMN degradation and faster at pH 11 than in acidic or neutral media. Combined with the UV photolysis, HP showed a higher oxidation rate than other oxidants, whereas PMS and PDS proved to be more efficient in combinations with PCD. In contrast to low-to-moderate mineralization of VMN in the UV/oxidant combinations, PCD and PCD/oxidant combinations appeared to be more effective, reaching up to 90% of TOC removal in acidic/neutral solutions. Application of extrinsic oxidants resulted in an energy efficiency of VMN 90% oxidation improved from 36 to 61 g kW√¢ÀÜ‚Äô1h√¢ÀÜ‚Äô1in HP-assisted photolysis, and from 195 to 250 g kW√¢ÀÜ‚Äô1h√¢ÀÜ‚Äô1in PCD with additions of HP and PDS, thus showing the promising character of the combined treatment."

In this regard, nanomaterials exhibiting antimicrobial properties represent a promising solution. Both metal and metal oxide nanomaterials are suitable candidates, even though their mechanisms of action vary. Multiple antimicrobial mechanisms can occur simultaneously or independently; this includes either direct contact with the pathogens, nanomaterial uptake, oxidative stress, ion release, or any of their combinations. However, due to their specific properties and more particularly fast settling, existing methods to study the antimicrobial properties of nanoparticles have not been specifically adapted in some cases. The development of methodologies that can assess the antimicrobial properties of metallic nanomaterials accurately is necessary. A cost-effective methodology with a straightforward set-up that enables the easy and quick assessment of the antimicrobial properties of metal nanoparticles with high accuracy has been developed. The methodology is also capable of confirming whether the killing mechanism involves ionic diffusion. Finally, Aloe Vera gel showed good properties for use as a medium for the development of antimicrobial ointment."

In particular, we find the most general spatially homogeneous and isotropic Berwald spacetimes, which are Finsler spacetimes that can be regarded as closest to pseudo-Riemannian geometry. They are defined by a Finsler Lagrangian built from a zero-homogeneous function on the tangent bundle, which encodes the velocity dependence of the Finsler Lagrangian in a very specific way. The obtained cosmological Berwald geometries are candidates for the description of the geometry of the universe, when they are obtained as solutions from a Finsler gravity equation."

However, the relationship between different space layouts and their consequent energy demands has not yet been systematically studied. This study thoroughly investigates such a relationship. In order to do so, a computational method was developed, which includes a method to generate space layouts featuring energy-related variables and an assessment method for energy demand. Additionally, a design of experiments was performed, and its results were used to analyse the relationship between space layouts and energy demands. In order to identify their relationship, four types of design indicators of space layout were proposed, both for the overall layout and for each function. Finally, several optimisations were performed to minimise heating, cooling and lighting demands. The optimisation results showed that the maximum reduction between different layouts was up to 54% for lighting demand, 51% for heating demand and 38% for cooling demand. The relationship analysis shows that when comparing the four types of design indicators, the fa√É¬ßade area-to-floor area ratio showed a stronger correlation with energy demands than the fa√É¬ßade area ratio, floor area ratio and height-to-depth ratio. Overall, this study shows that designing a space layout helps to reduce energy demands for heating, cooling and lighting, and also provides a reference for other researchers and designers to optimise space layout with improved energy performance."

The emerging field of metabolomics can be utilized to detect a wide spectrum of intermediates and products of metabolism in body fluids that can be involved in the pathogenesis of AS. Research over the past decade has reinforced this idea by linking AS to circulating acylcarnitines, glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, and amino acids, among other metabolite species. Some of these metabolites influence AS through traditional cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, diabetes, smoking), while others seem to act independently through both known and unknown pathophysiological mechanisms. We propose the term √¢‚Ç¨Àúarteriometabolomics' to indicate the research that applies metabolomics methods to study AS. The √¢‚Ç¨Àúarteriometabolomics' approach has the potential to allow more personalized cardiovascular risk stratification, disease monitoring, and treatment selection. One of its major goals is to uncover the causal metabolic pathways of AS. Such pathways could represent valuable treatment targets in vascular ageing."

In the current study, our aim was to fabricate Cell-CNT composite fibers and study their electro-mechanical response as linear actuators in aqueous and propylene carbonate-based electrolyte solutions. While the response was (expectedly) strongly solvent dependent, the different solvents also revealed unexpected phenomena. Cell-CNT fibers in propylene carbonate revealed a strong back-relaxation process at low frequencies, and also a frequency dependent response direction change (change of actuation direction). Cell-CNT fibers operated in aqueous electrolyte showed response typical to electrochemical capacitors including expansion at discharging with controllable actuation dependence on charge density. While the response was similarly stable in both electrolyte solution systems, the aqueous electrolytes were clearly favorable for Cell-CNT with 3.4 times higher conductivities, 4.3 times higher charge densities and 11 times higher strain."

While there is plenty of research on how to scaffold children's learning of cognitive skills, there is limited knowledge on how to enhance collaborative case-based learning of research ethics competencies in HE contexts. Our aim was to identify whether, how and when scaffolding is needed with various expertise levels to support development of ethics competencies. To identify and evaluate scaffolding during collaborative case-based ethics training we synthesised a scaffolding framework consisting of three levels: techniques, mechanisms and process. We organised 5 training sessions where 46 participants (including bachelor, master and PhD students as well as junior and senior academics) were involved. Data was collected as part of action research from group-work recordings and transcribed verbatim. Deductive qualitative analysis was implemented on transcripts based on the scaffolding framework. Our analysis revealed that structural scaffolding alone (learning material) is not always efficient with bachelor level students, they also require oral scaffolding when the need becomes apparent. Master's level students benefited most from wording the issues they needed to focus on. Doctoral students and senior academics needed scaffolding to maintain goal orientation. We end our article with some recommendations for facilitators of ethics education, and encourage using the scaffolding framework also in complex problem-solving beyond ethics training."

Emergency remote education created both challenges and positives for different stakeholders, especially during the early part of this staggering situation. This study aims to describe the challenges and positives encountered by people in different roles, using data from the Facebook group √¢‚Ç¨ÀúHomeschooling with technology' from 6 March&26 April 2020. Members of the Facebook group were divided into eight role groups. A qualitative method study design was used and inductive thematic analysis of 130 messages posted by different roles was conducted. 72 messages were coded as expressing negative sentiments and describing various problems and challenges, which were then used to create a thematic map with seven main themes. Two themes (teachers' unreadiness and problems related to technology) were reported by all stakeholder groups except members from government institutions, who did not post any messages about challenges. Seven main themes describing positives in the Facebook messages were identified using 58 messages coded as expressing positive sentiments. All role groups posted some messages about the positives but only the theme √¢‚Ç¨ÀúStress management' was mentioned by all roles. Several themes (e.g., digital tools, teachers) included both negative and positive reports. The results help capture the effect of changing roles on challenges and positives experienced by different stakeholders during the implementation of emergency remote education, which can be used for future application of distance learning in education."

The sequence of the oxides from surface to substrate along with the layer thickness had an influence on the hardness causing rises and declines in hardness along the depth yet did not affect the elastic modulus. Hardness varied from 8 to 11 GPa for the laminates having higher dependence on the structure near the surface than at higher depths. Triple-layered Al2O3/Ta2O5/Al2O3laminate possessed the most even rise of hardness along the depth and possessed the highest hardness out of the laminates (11 GPa at 40 nm). Elastic modulus had steady values along the depth of the films between 145 and 155 GPa.

We compared the metabolomic profiles of the lesional skin, non-lesional skin and blood sera of AD and PS. Skin biopsies from 15 patients with AD, 20 patients with PS and 17 controls were collected, and 25 patients with AD, 55 patients with PS and 63 controls were recruited for the blood serum analysis. Serum and skin samples were analyzed using a targeted approach to find the concentrations of 188 metabolites and their ratios. A total of 19 metabolites differed in the comparison of lesional skins, one metabolite in non-lesional skins and 5 metabolites in blood sera. Although we found several metabolomic similarities between PS and AD, clear differences were outlined. Sphingomyelins were elevated in lesional skin of AD, implying a deficient barrier function. Increased levels of phosphatidylcholines, carnitines and asymmetric dimethylarginine in PS lesional skin and carnitines amino acids in the PS serum pointed to elevated cell proliferation. The comparison of the metabolomic profiles of AD and PS skin and sera outlined distinct patterns that were well correlated with the differences in the pathogenetic mechanisms of these two chronic inflammatory dermatoses."

Increasing empathetic awareness in the professional domain and in the customer interface could benefit both customer and employee satisfaction, but heart rate sharing in this context needs to consider issues around physiological monitoring of employees, appropriate level of intimacy, as well as the productivity outlook. In this study, we explore heart rate sharing at the workplace and study its effects on task performance. Altogether, 124 participants completed a collaborative visual guidance task using a chat box with heart rate visualization. Participants' feedback about heart rate sharing reveal themes such as a stronger sense of human contact and increased self-reflection, but also raise concerns around unnecessity, intimacy, privacy and negative interpretations. Live heart rate was always measured, but to investigate the effect of heart rate sharing on task performance, half of the customers were told that they were seeing a recording, and half were told that they were seeing the advisor's live heart beat. We found a negative link between awareness and task performance. We also found that higher ratings of usefulness of the heart rate visualization were associated with increased feelings of closeness. These results reveal that intimacy and privacy issues are particularly important for heart rate sharing in professional contexts, that preference modulates the effects of heart rate sharing on social closeness, and that heart rate sharing may have a negative effect on performance."

The controllers for vehicle power transmissions may include model-based or model-free approaches and must provide high transmission efficiency, fast engagement and low jerk. Most vehicle automatic transmissions are using torque converters with transmission efficiencies up to 96%. This paper presents the use of fuzzy logic control for a dry clutch in parallel hybrid electric vehicles. This controller can minimize the loss of power transmission since it can offer a higher transmission efficiency, up to 99%, with faster engagement, lower jerk and, thus, higher driving comfortability with lower cost. Fuzzy logic control is one of the model-free schemes. It can be combined with AI algorithms, neuro networks and virtual reality technologies in future development. Fuzzy logic control can avoid the complex modelling while maintaining the system's high stability amid uncertainties and imprecise information. Experiments show that fuzzy logic can reduce the clutch slip and vibration. The new system provides 2% faster engagement speed than the torque converter and eliminates 70% of noise and vibration less than the manual transmission clutch."

In wheat, AM fungal responsiveness and benefits of symbiosis vary among varieties. This study explored the role of soil compaction in this variation.MethodsWe examined in a field experiment how soil compaction affects AM fungal colonization and biomass in five spring wheat varieties, and how these varieties differ in their AM-mediated phosphorus (P) uptake. We also studied soil properties, and AM fungal community composition in roots and soil.ResultsSoil compaction increased AM fungal colonization in the variety Alderon, characterized by root traits that indicate inefficient P uptake. Wheat P concentration and P:N ratio in Alderon and Diskett increased with increased root AM fungal colonization and biomass. In Diskett, which is the most cultivated spring wheat variety in Sweden and has intermediate root traits, total P content per m2also increased with root AM fungal colonization and biomass.ConclusionsSome wheat varieties, potentially those characterized by P inefficient root traits, such as Alderon, may depend more on AM-mediated P uptake in compacted than in non-compacted soil. Increased P uptake with increased AM fungal colonization in Diskett suggests that efficient root and AM-mediated nutrient uptake can occur simultaneously in a modern variety. Breeding varieties that use roots and AM symbiosis as complementary strategies for nutrient uptake could improve nutrient uptake efficiency and help farmers achieve stable yields in varying conditions."

The effects of drugs on adipokine concentrations have only been evaluated in very few studies, although they may be of clinical importance. This study aimed to assess whether the concentrations of circulating adipokines could predict subclinical atherosclerosis in patients with T2DM, as well as their interactions with commonly used cardiovascular drugs.Materials and Methods: Our population-based cross-sectional multicentric study included 216 participants with T2DM but without previously diagnosed atherosclerosis. The carotid artery intima&media thickness (IMT), plaque and ankle&brachial index (ABI) metrics were measured. Resistin, visfatin, retinol-binding protein 4, high molecular weight adiponectin and leptin levels were evaluated using Luminex's xMAP technology.Results: Visfatin and resistin concentrations correlated positively with IMT (p= 0.002 andp= 0.009, respectively). The correlation of visfatin to IMT √¢‚Ä∞¬• 1.0 mm was significant in males (p< 0.001). Visfatin had a positive correlation with IMT √¢‚Ä∞¬• 1.0 mm or plaque (p= 0.008) but resistin only correlated with plaque (p= 0.049). Visfatin predicted IMT √¢‚Ä∞¬• 1.0 mm or plaque in patients on √é¬≤-blocker monotherapy (p= 0.031). Visfatin lost its ability to predict subclinical atherosclerosis in patients taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers or statins. After adjustments for risk factors for atherosclerosis and cardiovascular drugs, visfatin maintained an independent association with mean IMT (p= 0.003), IMT √¢‚Ä∞¬• 1.0 mm or plaque (p= 0.005) and ABI √¢‚Ä∞¬§ 0.9 (p= 0.029).Conclusions:Visfatin could be used as a marker of subclinical atherosclerosis in patients with T2DM, especially in males. The assessment of visfatin concentration could aid in identifying individuals who could benefit from implementing preventive measures against atherosclerosis."

Early and intensive lipid-lowering therapy targeting low-density lipoprotein cholesterol is a key strategy for reducing cardiovascular risk in post-acute myocardial infarction patients worldwide. This study aimed to assess patients' real-life lipid-lowering treatment gaps after acute myocardial infarction using a global network, TriNetX, of anonymous, real-time patient data. The uniqueness of the study was the use of the novel, evolving, and constantly improving TriNetX platform and the evaluation of its feasibility for clinical research.Materials and Methods:A retrospective study was conducted on global repository patients in 2020, diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction, with a three-year follow-up.Results: After acute myocardial infarction, the prescribing rate of lipid-lowering medication (statins, ezetimibe and PCSK9I) was insufficient to reach target LDL-C values. The mean LDL-C level decreased from 2.7 mmol/L (103 mg/dL) as measured on the day of AMI to 1.97 mmol/L (76 mg/dL) between 31D and 3M. During the second and third years, the mean LDL-C value was stable (around 2.0 mmol/L (78 mg/dL)). LDL-C goals were not sufficiently reached, as only 7&12% of patients were reported to have LDL-C values < 55 mg/dL (1.4 mmol/L) and 13&20% of patients were reported to have LDL-C values < 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) during the follow-up periods. This means that a substantial number of patients remain at a very high risk for CV complications and mortality. Most cardiovascular complications happen within three months after acute myocardial infarction.Conclusions:Gaps remain between the recommendations for managing LDL-C in guidelines and what occurs in real life. The TriNetX platform is an innovative platform with significant potential and should be further developed for clinical research, as it enables the use of valuable interinstitutional data."

Descriptive data,t-test, Mann&Whitney or √è‚Ä°2test, and Pearson's correlation were applied.Results: Participants (skiingn= 81, cyclingn= 29, runningn= 26; mean age 51.7 √Ç¬± 7.1 years old) had previously attended a median of 35 (IQR 17.5&66) marathons and travelled 2111.5 (IQR 920&4565) km. Recovery of HR and BP after finishing and recovery time was insufficient and not associated with marathon preparation. Running was the most burdensome for HR, and cycling was most taxing for BP. Chronic diseases did not influence participation in the marathon.Conclusions: The preparation for the marathon was mainly sufficient, but recovery after the marathon was worrisome. Marathons are demanding for √¢‚Ä∞¬•45 year old males and may be too strenuous an activity that has deleterious effects on health."

So far, knowledge regarding distance learning has been contradictory and gathered mostly in a quantitative manner. Aim: The aim of the following article is to examine the distance-learning experiences of four youngsters aged 16 from the DigiGen project exploratory pilot study in Estonia: a country known for its digital development. The study focuses on how learning was construed during distance learning in the experiences of young people. Method: These experiences, gathered in four semi-structured in-depth interviews, are placed in the framework of the theory of transactional distance and critical discourse analysis. Results: As the results indicate, the distance-learning experiences are derived from the structure and organisation of the distance learning: the more rigid the structure, the more difficult it was for the students. Five main discourses emerged regarding how youngsters construed learning during distance learning: (1) school building is for learning; (2) teachers teach instead of self-learning; (3) learning as a forced activity; (4) avoiding asking for help; and dominant in all the discourses was (5) avoiding responsibility. Discussion and  According to the results, distance learning is multifaceted and young people have ambivalent experiences from a distance learning."

Pulsating arterial blood flow, providing access to cardiac-related parameters, involves the whole body. Unobtrusive and continuous acquisition of electrical bioimpedance (EBI) and photoplethysmography (PPG) constitute important techniques for monitoring the peripheral arteries, requiring novel approaches and clever means. Methods: In this work, five peripheral arteries were selected for EBI and PPG signal acquisition. The acquisition sites were evaluated based on the signal morphological parameters. A small-data-based deep learning model, which increases the data by dividing them into cardiac periods, was proposed to evaluate the continuity of the signals. Results: The highest sensitivity of EBI was gained for the carotid artery (0.86%), three times higher than that for the next best, the posterior tibial artery (0.27%). The excitation signal parameters affect the measured EBI, confirming the suitability of classical 100 kHz frequency (average probability of 52.35%). The continuity evaluation of the EBI signals confirmed the advantage of the carotid artery (59.4%), while the posterior tibial artery (49.26%) surpasses the radial artery (48.17%). The PPG signal, conversely, commends the location of the posterior tibial artery (97.87%). Conclusions: The peripheral arteries are highly suitable for non-invasive EBI and PPG signal acquisition. The posterior tibial artery constitutes a candidate for the joint acquisition of EBI and PPG signals in sensor-fusion-based wearable devices: an important finding of this research."

Pulse wave signals contain valuable information about the cardiovascular system and heart status. However, signal acquisition in wearables poses challenges, particularly when using electrical sensors, due to factors like the distance from the heart, body movement, and suboptimal electrode placement. Methods: Electrical bioimpedance (EBI) measurements using bipolar and tetrapolar electrode systems were employed for pulse wave signal acquisition from the wrist in both perpendicular and distal configurations. Signal preprocessing techniques, including baseline removal via Hankel matrix methods, normalization, cross-correlation, and peak detection, were applied to improve signal quality. This study describes the combination of sensor-level signal acquisition and processing for accurate wearable HR estimation. Results: The bipolar system was shown to produce larger√é‚ÄùZ(t), while the tetrapolar system demonstrated higher sensitivity. Distal placement of the electrodes yielded greater√é‚ÄùZ(t)(up to 0.231√é¬©) when targeting both wrist arteries. Bandpass filtering resulted in a better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), achieving 3.6 dB for the best bipolar setup and 4.8 dB for the tetrapolar setup, compared to 2.6 and 3.3 dB SNR, respectively, with the Savitzky&Golay filter. The custom HR estimation algorithm presented in this paper demonstrated improved accuracy over a reference method, achieving an average error of 1.8 beats per minute for the best bipolar setup, with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 8%. Conclusions: The analysis supports the feasibility of using bipolar electrode setups on the wrist and highlights the importance of electrode positioning relative to the arteries. The proposed signal processing method, featuring a preprocessing pipeline and HR estimation algorithm, provides a proof-of-concept demonstration for HR estimation from EBI signals acquired at the wrist."

The effect of pelotherapy is complex, functioning through several mechanisms, and depends on the skin's functional condition. The current research objective was to develop a methodology and electrodes to assess the passage of the chemical and biologically active compounds of curative mud through human skin by performing electrical bioimpedance (EBI) analysis. Methods: The methodology included local area mud pack and simultaneous tap water compress application on the forearms with the comparison to the measurements of the dry skin. A custom-designed small-area gold-plated electrode on a rigid printed circuit board, in a tetrapolar configuration, was designed. A pilot study experiment with ten volunteers was performed. Results: Our results indicated the presence of an effect of pelotherapy, manifested by the varying electrical properties of the skin. Distinguishable difference in the measured real part of impedance (R) emerged, showing a very strong correlation between the dry and tap-water-treated skin (r = 0.941), while a poor correlation between the dry and mud-pack-treated skin (r = 0.166) appeared. The findings emerged exclusively in the frequency interval of 10 kHz √¢‚Ç¨¬¶1 MHz and only forR. Conclusions: EBI provides a promising tool for monitoring the variations in the electrical properties of the skin, including the skin barrier. We foresee developing smart devices for promoting the exploitation of spa therapies."

The purpose of this work was to examine whether and to what extent the different dimensions of the perceived controlling teaching questionnaire predict students' basic psychological needs, motivations, and physical activities during leisure-time. Methods: A total of 299 students (164 boys and 135 girls) from four Estonian general education schools and two vocational education institutions participated in the study. Students filled in the questionnaire of study variables. A variance-based structural model was used to test the research hypotheses. Results: The results revealed that different forms of controlling behaviours predicted psychological need frustration (√é¬≤ = 0.09&0.37;p< 0.01). Psychological need frustration predicted controlled motivation (√é¬≤ = 0.52;p< 0.01). Controlled motivation predicted subjective norms (√é¬≤ = 0.51;p< 0.01). Intention was predicted by attitudes (√é¬≤ = 0.30;p< 0.01), perceived behavioural control (√é¬≤ = 0.37;p< 0.01), and subjective norms (√é¬≤ = 0.15;p< 0. 01). Attitude was statistically significantly related to leisure-time physical activity (√é¬≤ = 0.09;p< 0.05). The model describes 10% of students' physical activity in the context of leisure-time.  The results of this study highlight that physical education teachers should avoid using controlling behaviours if the aim is to avoid frustrating their students' psychological needs, which might have detrimental effect on students' leisure-time physical activity via controlled forms of motivation."

There were two research foci: first, ethical decision-making related to treating patients in the context of potential medical resource scarcity, and second, other psychosocial factors for healthcare professionals pertaining to coping, role conflicts, and the availability of institutional support. Methods: An online survey was conducted in the fall of 2020 amongst the frontline healthcare professionals working in the three most impacted hospitals; respondents were also drawn from two ambulance services. The focus of the survey was on the first wave of COVID-19 (spring 2020). A total of 215 respondents completed the quantitative survey and qualitative data were gathered from open comments. Results: Over half of the surveyed healthcare professionals in Estonia expressed confidence in their roles during the pandemic. More than half cited the complex ethical aspects related to their decisions as their main source of doubt and uncertainty. In response to this uncertainty, Estonian healthcare professionals drew on their previous training and experience, the policies and guidelines of their institution, and support from their colleagues, to aid their decision-making during the pandemic. Conclusions: Although frontline healthcare professionals faced difficult decisions during the first wave of the pandemic, overall, most agreed that experiencing the pandemic reconfirmed that their work mattered greatly."

Consequently, this article explores various digital innovation challenges, opportunities, and elements for schools, as well as proposed school-driven interventions. The paper seeks to open conversations among various international bodies and educational stakeholders, leading to school actors taking ownership of educational projects and school innovation. Methods: A traditional literature review was adopted to analyse the subject of Digital Transformation in Education (DTE). The traditional literature review is a comprehensive and critical overview based on the past and current literature on a subject matter without stringent methodology. Through the literature review methodology, existing materials on the subject matter are subsequently used. Terms and concepts about school innovation and management/leadership were extracted for consideration. These served as a basis for formulating a reference DTE model for interventions. This paper is underpinned by two main conceptual and theoretical bases: (i) The theory of school-based management and its related indicators, and (ii) Michael Fullan's concept of school innovation, which is based on the three key factors of Technology, Pedagogy, and Change knowledge. Fullan's concept is extended to showcase how Active Learning (AL) can inform pedagogical innovation. Results: This paper presents a school-based digital transformation in the education reference model as the outcome. The model uses concept maps to showcase the interrelations between DTE indicators and concepts, and the linkages around which Digital Transformation in Education could be developed as a School-Based Managed (SBM) agenda."

In contrast, problematic Facebook use has been found to be a robust predictor of depressive symptoms. This suggests that when intense Facebook use results in a problematic usage pattern, it may indirectly predict depressive symptoms. However, this mediation pathway has never been examined. Moreover, it remains unclear whether the possible indirect relationship between Facebook use intensity and depressive symptoms through problematic Facebook use is moderated by demographic (age), and personality (neuroticism and extraversion) characteristics.MethodsTo address these gaps, we conducted an online cross-sectional study (n=√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞210, 55% female, age range: 18&70√Ç¬†years old, Mage=√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞30.26, SD√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞=√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞12.25). We measured Facebook use intensity (Facebook Intensity Scale), problematic Facebook use (Bergen Facebook Addiction Scale), depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale Revised), and neuroticism and extraversion (Ten Item Personality Inventory).ResultsA mediation analysis revealed that problematic Facebook use fully mediates the relationship between Facebook use intensity and depressive symptoms. Moreover, a moderated mediation analysis demonstrated that this indirect relationship is especially strong among young users and users scoring high on neuroticism.Conclusions These findings expand our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the relationship between Facebook use intensity and depressive symptoms and describe user characteristics that act as vulnerability factors in this relationship."

However, the formation pathways of Fe carbonate, namely siderite, remain disputed. Here, we provide photomicrographs, Fe, C and O isotope of siderite, and organic C isotope of the whole rock from the ~2.52 Ga Dagushan BIF in the Anshan area, China, to discuss the origin of siderite. There are small magnetite grains that occur as inclusions within siderite, suggesting a diagenetic origin of the siderite. Moreover, the siderites have a wide range of iron isotope compositions (√é¬¥56FeSd) from √¢ÀÜ‚Äô0.180√¢‚Ç¨¬∞ to +0.463√¢‚Ç¨¬∞, and a relatively negative C isotope composition (√é¬¥13CSd= √¢ÀÜ‚Äô6.20√¢‚Ç¨¬∞ to √¢ÀÜ‚Äô1.57√¢‚Ç¨¬∞). These results are compatible with the reduction of an Fe(III)-oxyhydroxide precursor to dissolved Fe(II) through microbial dissimilatory iron reduction (DIR) during early diagenesis. Partial reduction of the precursor and possible mixing with seawater Fe(II) could explain the presence of siderite with negative √é¬¥56Fe, while sustained reaction of residual Fe(III)-oxyhydroxide could have produced siderite with positive √é¬¥56Fe values. Bicarbonate derived from both DIR and seawater may have provided a C source for siderite formation. Our results suggest that microbial respiration played an important role in the formation of siderite in the late Archean Dagushan BIF."

Biomass could be one such renewable material that is available in large quantities. However, biomass physicochemical properties are a challenge for its industrial application. Recently, the torrefaction process was developed to improve the fuel characteristics of biomass. However, in recent days, energy production has slowly been shifting towards solar and wind, and restrictions on thermal power plants are increasing. Thus, there will be a need to find alternative market opportunities for the torrefaction industry. In that regard, there is a quest to find alternative applications of torrefaction products other than energy production. This paper presents a couple of alternative applications of torrefied biomass. Torrefaction process can be used as a biomass pretreatment option for biochemical conversion processes. The other alternative applications of torrefied biomass are using it as a reducing agent in metallurgy, as a low-cost adsorbent, in carbon-black production, and as a filler material in plastics. The use of torrefied biomass in fermentation and steel production is validated through a few laboratory experiments, and the results are looking attractive. The lower sugar yield is the main challenge in the case of the microbial application of torrefied biomass. The lower mechanical strength is the challenge in the case of using it as a reducing agent in a blast furnace. To date, very few studies are available in the literature for all the highlighted applications of torrefied biomass. There is a need for extensive experimental validation to identify the operational feasibility of these applications."

For the younger generation entering the professional market, this is particularly relevant as, in this context, emotions are managed and communicated in ways (and channels) that are different from what they are used to and that can easily lead to misunderstandings. Therefore, it is important to analyze how young people deal with, understand, and interpret emotions, particularly in the context of a professional career where the ability to dialogue with different people and how to get around problems in a healthy and resilient way is essential. This analysis will allow one to design and create tools that allow the younger generation to improve their emotional intelligence and competence.

This paper studies the prospects for wood pellet production in Kazakhstan through the lens of business model adjustment in a microenterprise in Kazakhstan. This study focuses on answering the following questions: (1) How do microenterprises propose, create, deliver and capture value through business models in the wood industry? (2) What are the opportunities and challenges relating to these business models in the context of wood pellet production in Kazakhstan? Kazakhstan has a high potential for biomass production, providing a particularly interesting case for analysing how microenterprises can tap into this potential to create value. This paper combines an analysis of bioenergy and forestry trends with a qualitative case study. The analysis of the business model is based on Osterwalder's business model canvas. The value proposition of the enterprise studied herein is to provide a local biomass-based alternative to fossil fuels. The overall growth of wood-based industries in Kazakhstan and the national movement towards renewable energy create favourable prospects for microenterprises engaged in the production of wood pellets; however, these industries are also characterised by high institutional and regulatory dependencies."

The aim of the study was to describe the biosecurity levels and management practices of ASF outbreak and uninfected herds and to identify potential risk factors for ASF introduction. The biosecurity score of ASF outbreak herds was significantly lower compared to uninfected herds. This may reflect general improvement in the application of biosecurity measures over time in Estonian pig farms as the data on uninfected herds were collected later, at a time when intensified official controls may have had their effect. Larger herds were more at risk of being √¢‚Ç¨Àúoutbreak herds' compared to smaller herds. The biosecurity parameters significantly associated with √¢‚Ç¨Àúoutbreak herd' status in statistical analysis were mostly related to indirect contacts with the outside farm environment. The biosecurity barriers applied in Estonian pig farms have not been sufficient to avoid the introduction of ASF and need critical evaluation and improvement. Reduction of all contacts between the farm and the external environment should be emphasized in a situation where ASF is circulating in wild boar populations close to pig farms."

However, the cellular events regulated by betulin and precise molecular mechanisms under these processes have been begun to be understood only recently. Today, we know that betulin can exert important anticancer activities through modulation of diverse cellular pathways. In this review article, betulin-regulated molecular signaling is unraveled and presented with a special focus on its participation in anti-inflammatory processes, especially by modulating nuclear factor-√é¬∫B (NF-√é¬∫B), prostaglandin/COX, and nuclear factor erythroid2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-mediated cascades. By regulating these diverse pathways, betulin can not only affect the development and progression of different cancers, but also enhance the antitumor action of traditional therapeutic modalities. It is expected that by overcoming the low bioavailability of betulin by encapsulating it into nanocarriers, this promising natural compound may provide novel possibilities for targeting inflammation-related cancers."

As the technology combines traits from the fields of distributed systems, cryptography, peer-to-peer networking and other technologies, and carries promise of changing how managerial and legal processes are conducted, research focused on blockchain often exceeds the boundaries of a single discipline (Zhang and Lee, 2020). Furthermore, the interdisciplinary scope of the research on BCT is prompted by a range of industries for which BCT use cases and proofs of concepts can be found today. A recent study on BCT projects (D√ºdder et al., 2019) shows that the successful design, development, and implementation of blockchain-based business solutions requires deployment of interdisciplinary teams of experts with domain-specific knowledge. In this paper, we present four scientific disciplines and methods for interdisciplinary education aimed at building a knowledge base, which is at the same time domain-specific and interdisciplinary. Such knowledge is much sought by experts concerned with the development and integration of enterprise blockchain solutions (Forbes, 2019). The presented conceptualization of a meaningful interdisciplinary education on BCT is based on the developments of √¢‚Ç¨≈ìBlockNet√¢‚Ç¨¬ù project (D√ºdder et al., 2020), which has recently introduced an interdisciplinary blockchain modular online course for universities' master programs and on-the-job trainings."

Consequently, recommendation systems have become a crucial part of any successful e-commerce service. Although various recommendation techniques could be used in e-commerce, a considerable amount of attention has been drawn to session-based recommendation systems in recent years. This growing interest is due to security concerns over collecting personalized user behavior data, especially due to recent general data protection regulations. In this work, we present a comprehensive evaluation of the state-of-the-art deep learning approaches used in the session-based recommendation. In session-based recommendation, a recommendation system counts on the sequence of events made by a user within the same session to predict and endorse other items that are more likely to correlate with their preferences. Our extensive experiments investigate baseline techniques (e.g., nearest neighbors and pattern mining algorithms) and deep learning approaches (e.g., recurrent neural networks, graph neural networks, and attention-based networks). Our evaluations show that advanced neural-based models and session-based nearest neighbor algorithms outperform the baseline techniques in most scenarios. However, we found that these models suffer more in the case of long sessions when there exists drift in user interests, and when there are not enough data to correctly model different items during training. Our study suggests that using the hybrid models of different approaches combined with baseline algorithms could lead to substantial results in session-based recommendations based on dataset characteristics. We also discuss the drawbacks of current session-based recommendation algorithms and further open research directions in this field."

In this study, we propose a multi-branch 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) that utilizes different hyperparameter values for each branch and is more flexible to data from different subjects. Our model, EEGNet Fusion, achieves 84.1% and 83.8% accuracy when tested on the 103-subjecteegmmidbdataset for executed and imagined motor actions, respectively. The model achieved statistically significantly higher results compared with three state-of-the-art CNN classifiers: EEGNet, ShallowConvNet, and DeepConvNet. However, the computational cost of the proposed model is up to four times higher than the model with the lowest computational cost used for comparison."

Despite their importance, they are one of the most impacted ecosystems because of combined influences of climate change, pollution, and direct conversion and loss. A major driver of environmental impacts is shrimp farming and this is particularly acute in the semi-arid northeast of Brazil, where mangroves are constrained in a narrow band along ephemeral estuaries that are often impacted by multi-year droughts. Recent changes to Brazilian law, in particular the Forest Code, have weakened protection for mangroves and associated √¢‚Ç¨≈ìapicum√¢‚Ç¨¬ù (salt pan) ecosystems. In NE Brazil, most shrimp ponds are converted from mangrove-adjacent √¢‚Ç¨≈ìapicuns√¢‚Ç¨¬ù rather than the mangroves themselves with periodic hydrological connectivity through dammed channels, allowing the flushing of effluents. As a result, the main impacts on mangroves are typically indirect, because of pollution inputs from shrimp pond effluents and associated loss of ecosystem services including reductions in primary productivity, carbon storage capacity, resilience to other environmental stressors, their efficiency as estuarine filters, and biodiversity and abundance of subsistence use of marine species. Soil damage and infrastructure remaining after shrimp pond deactivation impairs mangrove recovery. This extends the duration of the damage and allows the occupation of degraded areas by other activities that can permanently impair ecosystem function. In this review, we address several aspects of the shrimp culture boom in NE Brazilian, their features and consequences, and the future of mangroves in the region considering climate change and rising poverty. Our conclusions on the practices and outcomes of shrimp farming in mangroves are likely to apply to areas with similar environmental settings, e.g., semiarid regions worldwide, and particularly in the Latin America and Caribbean region, and our findings can be taken into account to improve conservation and management of these forests at the least to a regional scale."

Based on a series of semi-structured interviews conducted with small Swedish firms, our findings reveal certain external (i.e., suppliers and customers) and internal (i.e., employees, organizational culture, and competitive advantage) factors that are strongly linked to the maintenance of sustainability practices. Apart from these, the longevity of the business was identified as an additional sustainability maintenance factor. This factor has not been discussed previously in the literature, so given its strength, we suggest to have it stand separately. The findings further indicate that Swedish SMEs are not limited by size concerning their sustainability practices but they are consciously working on progressing in their efforts. Furthermore, drawing on our findings we provide practical implications that will help business owners', managers, and policymakers to better enable sustainability practices."

Since the discovery of RNAi and their mechanism of action, it has shown promises in targeted therapy for various diseases including cancer. The ability of RNAi to selectively silence the carcinogenic gene makes them ideal as cancer therapeutics. Oral delivery is the ideal route of administration of drug administration because of its patients' compliance and convenience. However, orally administered RNAi, for instance, siRNA, must cross various extracellular and intracellular biological barriers before it reaches the site of action. It is very challenging and important to keep the siRNA stable until they reach to the targeted site. Harsh pH, thick mucus layer, and nuclease enzyme prevent siRNA to diffuse through the intestinal wall and thereby induce a therapeutic effect. After entering the cell, siRNA is subjected to lysosomal degradation. Over the years, various approaches have been taken into consideration to overcome these challenges for oral RNAi delivery. Therefore, understanding the challenges and recent development is crucial to offer a novel and advanced approach for oral RNAi delivery. Herein, we have summarized the delivery strategies for oral delivery RNAi and recent advancement towards the preclinical stages."

This review examines the impact of uremic toxins, which accumulate in CKD due to a failing kidney function, on cardiovascular calcification. A systematic literature search identified 41 uremic toxins that have been studied in relation to cardiovascular calcification. For 29 substances, a potentially causal role in cardiovascular calcification was addressed in in vitro or animal studies. A calcification-inducing effect was revealed for 16 substances, whereas for three uremic toxins, namely the guanidino compounds asymmetric and symmetric dimethylarginine, as well as guanidinosuccinic acid, a calcification inhibitory effect was identified in vitro. At a mechanistic level, effects of uremic toxins on calcification could be linked to the induction of inflammation or oxidative stress, smooth muscle cell osteogenic transdifferentiation and/or apoptosis, or alkaline phosphatase activity. For all middle molecular weight and protein-bound uremic toxins that were found to affect cardiovascular calcification, an increasing effect on calcification was revealed, supporting the need to focus on an increased removal efficiency of these uremic toxin classes in dialysis. In conclusion, of all uremic toxins studied with respect to calcification regulatory effects to date, more uremic toxins promote rather than reduce cardiovascular calcification processes. Additionally, it highlights that only a relatively small part of uremic toxins has been screened for effects on calcification, supporting further investigation of uremic toxins, as well as of associated post-translational modifications, on cardiovascular calcification processes."

Clinical statistics demonstrate clear sex differences in risk, prevalence, mortality rates, and response to treatment for different entities of CVD. The reason for this remains poorly understood. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are emerging as key mediators and biomarkers of CVD. Similarly, current knowledge on differential regulation, expression, and pathology-associated function of ncRNAs between sexes is minimal. Here, we provide a state-of-the-art overview of what is known on sex differences in ncRNA research in CVD as well as discussing the contributing biological factors to this sex dimorphism including genetic and epigenetic factors and sex hormone regulation of transcription. We then focus on the experimental models of CVD and their use in translational ncRNA research in the cardiovascular field. In particular, we want to highlight the importance of considering sex of the cellular and pre-clinical models in clinical studies in ncRNA research and to carefully consider the appropriate experimental models most applicable to human patient populations. Moreover, we aim to identify sex-specific targets for treatment and diagnosis for the biggest socioeconomic health problem globally."

Central to Carnaval Soncent are the allegorical cars (referred to as parade floats outside of Cabo Verde) that come into being through informal craft processes. Significantly, the designers and makers embrace, even welcome, the material demise of these larger-than-life artefacts that they so painstakingly construct. This paper considers how this embrace of the material vulnerability of the artefact ‚Äì its decay ‚Äì forms an essential part of its expressive capacity. Using the notions of ‚Äòconceptual compression‚Äô (Fauconnier, Turner 2003) and ‚Äòperformance characteristics‚Äô (Skibo, Schiffer 2008) I analyse the ‚ÄòHired to Farm‚Äô allegorical car, from the 2017 edition of Carnaval Soncent, to illustrate how it functions as a visualised memory. The analysis suggests that, during its composition, the allegorical car‚Äôs conceptual content becomes entangled with its materiality, creating a meaningful tension that facilitates the eventual de-composition, or release, of its emotionally charged content. This release detangles the content and materials to, once again, make them available for the re-making of shared experiences, memories, and the community."

However, the presence of long-chain conjugated double bonds are responsible for chemical instability, poor water solubility, low bioavailability and high susceptibility to oxidation. The application of a nanoencapsulation technique has thus become a vital means to enhance stability of carotenoids under physiological conditions due to their small particle size, high aqueous solubility and improved bioavailability. This review intends to overview the advances in preparation, characterization, biocompatibility and application of nanocarotenoids reported in research/review papers published in peer-reviewed journals over the last five years. More specifically, nanocarotenoids were prepared from both carotenoid extracts and standards by employing various preparation techniques to yield different nanostructures including nanoemulsions, nanoliposomes, polymeric/biopolymeric nanoparticles, solid lipid nanoparticles, nanostructured lipid nanoparticles, supercritical fluid-based nanoparticles and metal/metal oxide nanoparticles. Stability studies involved evaluation of physical stability and/or chemical stability under different storage conditions and heating temperatures for varied lengths of time, while the release behavior and bioaccessibility were determined by various in vitro digestion and absorption models as well as bioavailability through elucidating pharmacokinetics in an animal model. Moreover, application of nanocarotenoids for various biological applications including antioxidant, anticancer, antibacterial, antiaging, cosmetics, diabetic wound healing and hepatic steatosis were summarized."

In case of electrical bioimpedance acquisition, the variations can be 1000 times smaller than the entire measured value. Synchronous or lock-in measurement of these variations is discussed in the current paper, and novel measurement solutions are presented. Proposed methods are simple and robust when compared to other applicable solutions. A common feature shared by all members of the group of the proposed solutions is differentiation. It is achieved by calculating the differences between synchronously acquired consecutive samples, with lock-in integration and analog differentiation. All these methods enable inherent separation of variations from the static component of the signal. The variable component of the bioimpedance can, thus, be acquired using the full available dynamic range of the apparatus for its detection. Additive disturbing signals and omnipresent wideband noise are considered and the method for their reduction is proposed."

Specific features of energy-band structure of self-activated crystal CeF3are discussed, and its potential for a super-fast detection of ionizing radiation evaluated. Diffusion-controlled dipole&dipole interaction of Frenkel excitons is demonstrated to account well for the luminescence non-exponential decay kinetics providing information on the scales of excited regions created by photons of different energy. For 20 eV photons the radius of excited regions is estimated to be 10 nm, and for 200 eV photons it increases to 18 nm. Effective radius of excited regions of complicated shape created by 19 keV is as large as 80 nm and the diffusion length of Frenkel excitons over radiative time is 14 nm."

Sensor response time traces were recorded for strongly oxidizing (NO2, O3) and reducing (NH3, H2S) poisonous gases at ppb and ppm levels, respectively. The morphology of the MOX layer was modified by growth temperature during PLD, resulting in the optimization of the sensor response. Differences in decomposition or oxidation rates on catalytically active metal oxide (MOX) were utilized to achieve partial selectivity for pairs of gases that have similar adsorption and redox properties. The predominant selectivity towards ozone in most samples at different measuring conditions remained difficult to suppress. A distinct selectivity for H2S emerged at higher measurement temperatures (100&150 √Ç¬∞C), which was assigned to catalytic oxidation with O2. Several gas&MOX interaction mechanisms were advanced to tentatively explain the sensor behavior, including reversible electron transfer in the simplest case of NO2, decomposition via ionic transients for O3, and complex catalytic oxidative transformations for NH3and H2S."

However, this age group's use of information and communication technology (ICT) is not uniform, nor are the outcomes of their adaption to ICT. Shaped by their social environment and socioeconomic conditions, the potential benefits of children's and young people's ICT use may vary greatly, contributing to increased inequalities that exacerbate vulnerability for some while promoting health and well-being for others. This paper presents a protocol for conceptualising, systematically identifying and synthesising the literature on which conditions contribute to children and young people being negatively or positively impacted by their use of ICT. Here, children and young people are seen as social actors in four domains of their everyday lives illustrated through the digital ecosystem: family, leisure, education and civic participation. This protocol's overview of the actors' navigation within and across the different domains and potential for studying the interactions between the different spheres of the ecosystem may advance the understanding of both the risks and benefits facing children and young people in their digital lives."

This to create democratic cities. Connected to the field of smart cities and citizens, we present in this paper, the prototype of an urban digital twin for the 30,000-people town of Herrenberg in Germany. Urban digital twins are sophisticated data models allowing for collaborative processes. The herein presented prototype comprises (1) a 3D model of the built environment, (2) a street network model using the theory and method of space syntax, (3) an urban mobility simulation, (4) a wind flow simulation, and (5) a number of empirical quantitative and qualitative data using volunteered geographic information (VGI).

We conclude the paper with a discussion of the presented results and further research directions."

The churches in Estonia have envisioned Christian integrity in relation to the state differently in different times and stages of societal and cultural development. One could distinguish the following four types of relationships:the conflict, the harmony, the two kingdoms,andthe social servanthood. This article will focus on the characteristics of these relationship paradigms along with some personal, communal, and ecumenical examples in the sense of integrity of Estonian church-life from the last century to the present day when social servanthood seems to be most relevant."

(1980)stated that consumer psychological reactance extends beyond the existing scope of literature, which covers price, availability, and promotions. Therefore, during COVID-19, we investigated customer psychological reactance because of psychological distance. A few studies referred to the relationship between psychological distancing and psychological reactance (Abel and Mcqueen, 2020;Reiss et al., 2020;Chishima et al., 2021;Finsterwalder, 2021;Zhang et al., 2021) and the psychological reactance to freedom restoration in the study ofMoore and Fitzsimons (2014),Bessarabova et al. (2017), andZhang (2020). The work ofAkhtar et al. (2020)andSakai et al. (2021)also supported the relationship of psychological reactance with COVID-19 restrictions. However, the existing literature has largely ignored the investigation of psychological distancing as a predictor of psychological reactance in freedom restoration and compliance with COVID-19 restrictions. Further, when COVID-19 restrictions cause anger and negative thoughts, people are more likely to follow them. There isn't enough research on how psychological reactance affects compliance with COVID-19 restrictions. Lockdown restrictions have also been shown to improve psychological distancing measures that lead to psychological reactance (Foroudi et al., 2021), but have not been thoroughly investigated as a moderator for the relationship between psychological distancing and psychological reactance. Following that, we filled the gaps by investigating the psychological reactance caused by perceived social, temporal, and spatial distance in restaurants. We used a novel approach in examining consumers' psychological reactance from a psychological distance to restaurant consumers and developed and validated a research framework. We aim to confirm the structural relationships between constructs. First, we examined the consumers' psychological reactance developed by perceived social, temporal, and spatial distance at the food and beverage restaurants. Second, we investigated the freedom restoration and compliance with COVID-19 restrictions as the outcomes of consumers' psychological reactance. Third, we checked the moderation effect of lockdown restrictions reinforces the relationship of social, spatial, and temporal distancing with psychological reactance in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. We had the objectives for this study to help food and beverage restaurants with understanding the consumers' reactance during the COVID-19 pandemic when the restaurants apply distance measures and how this reactance can affect the much-needed compliance to COVID-19 measures. This study gives an insight into the food and beverage restaurants regarding the consumers' accepted dining, creative ways of applying COVID-19 precautionary measures, and compliance with government restrictions at the same time. We added to the body of knowledge on psychological distance, consumer psychology, service management, and consumer reactance. We also provided implications for the food and beverage industry to help restore consumer freedom."

We analyzed the antimicrobial usage in cows with CM (n= 11,420) in large dairy herds (n= 43) in Estonia. CM treatment data were collected during a 12-month study period. The antimicrobial usage was observed during the 21 days from the initiation of treatment, and the incidence of antimicrobial-treated CM was calculated for each study herd. The effect of intramammary (IMM), systemic, and combined (systemic and IMM) penicillin treatment of CM on the post-treatment somatic cell count (SCC) was analyzed using the treatment records of 2222 cows from 24 herds with a mixed multivariable linear regression model. The median incidence of antimicrobial-treated CM was 35.8 per 100 cow-years. Procaine benzylpenicillin and marbofloxacin were used in 6103 (35.5%, 95% CI 34.8&36.2) and 2839 (16.5%, 95% CI 16.0&17.1) CM treatments, respectively. Post-treatment SCC was higher after IMM penicillin therapy compared to systemic or combination therapy. Treatment of CM usually included first-choice antimicrobials, but different antimicrobial combinations were also widely used. The effect of procaine benzylpenicillin to post-treatment SCC was dependent on the administration route, cow parity, and days in milk. Further studies should evaluate the factors affecting veterinarians' choice of antimicrobial used in the treatment of CM."

Failure to first define such diagnostic criteria may lead research on pathogenesis and etiology to serious confounding biases and erroneous medical interpretations. This is particularly the case for electrohypersensitivity (EHS) and more particularly for the so-called √¢‚Ç¨≈ìprovocation tests√¢‚Ç¨¬ù, which do not investigate the causal origin of EHS but rather the EHS-associated particular environmental intolerance state with hypersensitivity to man-made electromagnetic fields (EMF). However, because those tests depend on multiple EMF-associated physical and biological parameters and have been conducted in patients without having first defined EHS objectively and/or endpoints adequately, they cannot presently be considered to be valid pathogenesis research methodologies. Consequently, the negative results obtained by these tests do not preclude a role of EMF exposure as a symptomatic trigger in EHS patients. Moreover, there is no proof that EHS symptoms or EHS itself are caused by psychosomatic or nocebo effects. This international consensus report pleads for the acknowledgement of EHS as a distinct neuropathological disorder and for its inclusion in the WHO International Classification of Diseases."

As these risks are likely to intensify in the future, there is an urgent need to build CMCH resilience. We argue that the current CMCH risk management paradigm narrowly focuses on the present and preservation. This tends to exclude debates about the contested nature of resilience and how it may be achieved beyond a strict preservationist approach. There is a need, therefore, to progress a broader and more dynamic framing of CMCH management that recognises the shift away from strict preservationist approaches and incorporates the complexity of heritage's socio-political contexts. Drawing on critical cultural heritage literature, we reconceptualise CMCH management by rethinking the temporality of cultural heritage. We argue that cultural heritage may exist in four socio-temporal manifestations (extant, lost, dormant, and potential) and that CMCH management consists of three broad socio-political steering processes (continuity, discontinuity, and transformation). Our reconceptualisation of CMCH management is a first step in countering the presentness trap in CMCH management. It provides a useful conceptual framing through which to understand processes beyond the preservationist approach and raises questions about the contingent and contested nature of CMCH, ethical questions around loss and transformation, and the democratisation of cultural heritage management."

As an effective alternative to laborious mineralogical and granulometric analysis, we present the first set of bulk-volume low-field magnetic susceptibility (MS) databases from beach and dune lithosomes in the Western Estonian archipelago: Harilaid cuspate foreland (westernmost Saaremaa Island) and Tahkuna strandplain (northernmost Hiiumaa Island). Readings were conducted bothin situfrom trench walls and on core subsamples. At the Tahkuna site, late Holocene beach ridges reveal substantially lower values: quartz-dominated dune sequences grade from 5&20 √é¬ºSI downward to diamagnetically dominated (√¢ÀÜ‚Äô1&7 √é¬ºSI) beach facies. Values are higher (20&140 √é¬ºSI) in historically reactivated parabolic dunes that are encroaching southward over the strandplain. At the Harilaid site, four beach dune ridges (height: 2&3 m) that span the past 250&300 years show a general increase in mean MS from 320&850 √é¬ºSI with decreasing age, with peaks of 1000&2000 √é¬ºSI below the dune crests (depth: ~0.3&0.6 m) likely related to contemporary wind acceleration during ridge aggradation. The highest mineralogical anomalies range from 2000&5500 √é¬ºSI in the historic dune sections and exceed 8000 √é¬ºSI along the actively eroding upper-berm segments, typical of HMCs generated by moderate storms. MS anomalies are likely correlated with high-amplitude electromagnetic signal responses in georadar records and provide useful information for optical luminescence sampling strategies. Our study demonstrates that magnetic susceptibility trends provide a useful means of rapidly assessing relative temporal changes in overall wave/wind climates, help identify and correlate discrete anomalies related to extreme events, serve as local beach/dune boundary indicators, and represent potentially quantifiable paleo-energy indices."

Complex climate-environmental interactions characterize these ecosystems and largely determine the productivity and state of these coastal forests. In the face of future climate change, understanding interactions between coastal tree growth and climate variability is important to promote sustainable coastal forests. In this study, we assessed the effect of microsite conditions on tree growth and the temporal and spatial variability of the relationship between climate and Scots pine growth at nine coastal sand dune sites located around the south Baltic Sea. At each site, we studied the growth of Scots pine growing at microsites located at the ridge and bottom of a dune and built a network of 18 ring-width and 18 latewood blue intensity chronologies. Across this network, we found that microsite has a minor influence on ring-width variability, basal area increment, latewood blue intensity, and climate sensitivity. However, at the local scale, microsite effects turned out to be important for growth and climate sensitivity at some sites. Correlation analysis indicated that the strength and direction of climate-growth responses for the ring-width and blue intensity chronologies were similar for climate variables over the 1903&2016 period. A strong and positive relationship between ring-width and latewood blue intensity chronologies with winter-spring temperature was detected at local and regional scales. We identified a relatively strong, positive influence of winter-spring/summer moisture availability on both tree-ring proxies. When climate-growth responses between two intervals (1903&1959, 1960&2016) were compared, the strength of growth responses to temperature and moisture availability for both proxies varied. More specifically, for the ring-width network, we identified decreasing temperature-growth responses, which is in contrast to the latewood blue intensity network, where we documented decreasing and increasing temperature-growth relationships in the north and south respectively. We conclude that coastal Scots pine forests are primarily limited by winter-spring temperature and winter-spring/summer drought despite differing microsite conditions. We detected some spatial and temporal variability in climate-growth relationships that warrant further investigation."

Despite its being a well-known electroactive material, widespread application of PEDOT:PSS also requires good understanding of its response. However, agreement on the interpretation of the material's activities, notably regarding actuation, is not unanimous. Our goal in this work is to study the behavior of trilayers with PEDOT:PSS electrodes printed on either side of a semi-interpenetrated polymer network membrane in propylene carbonate solutions of three different electrolytes, and to compare their electroactive, actuation, and energy storage behavior. The balance of apparent faradaic and non-faradaic processes in each case is discussed. The results show that the primarily cation-dominated response of the trilayers in the three electrolytes is actually remarkably different, with some rather uncommon outcomes. The different balance of the apparent charging mechanisms makes it possible to clearly select one electrolyte for potential actuation and another for energy storage application scenarios."

However, it is often the case that rural dwellers and, more specifically, rural NEETs, experience higher levels of marginalisation than their urban counterparts. Such marginalisation is evidenced by their exclusion from decision-making, public life, community, and society. These issues are compounded by an underdeveloped rural infrastructure, problematic access to education, limited employment opportunities, and a lack of meaningful social interaction. This study, a cross-sectional analysis, assesses a number (n = 51) of social interventions under the Youth Guarantee Programme from a social innovation perspective and presents a characterisation of examples of best practice across different dimensions of social innovations. This paper presents an examination of the potential of sustainable rural&urban ecosystems that are focused on supporting the symbiotic social innovation diffusion methods which can help to establish and sustain rural&urban pathways to improved education, employment, and training."

PMM2-CDG is the most frequently diagnosed CDG with a prevalence as high as one in 20,000. In contrast, the prevalence of other CDG types remains unknown. This study aimed to analyze the estimated prevalence of different N-linked protein glycosylation disorders. We extracted allele frequencies for diverse populations from The Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD), encompassing variant frequency information from 141,456 individuals. To identify pathogenic variants, we used the ClinVar database as a primary source. High confidence loss-of-function variants as defined by the LOFTEE algorithm were also classified as pathogenic. After summing up population frequencies for pathogenic alleles, estimated disease birth prevalence values with confidence intervals were calculated using the Bayesian method. We first validated our approach using two more common recessive disorders (cystic fibrosis and phenylketonuria) by showing that the estimated prevalences calculated from population allele frequencies were in accordance with previously published epidemiological studies. Among assessed 27 autosomal recessive N-glycosylation disorders, the only disease with estimated birth prevalence higher than one in 100,000 was PMM2-CDG (in both, all gnomAD individuals and those with European ancestry). The combined prevalence of 27 different N-glycosylation disorders was around one in 22,000 Europeans but varied considerably across populations. We will show estimated prevalence data from diverse populations and explain the possible pitfalls of this analysis. Still, we are confident that these data will guide CDG research and clinical care to identify CDG across populations."

Three cross-sectional electronic surveys were conducted among community pharmacies in Estonia in 2014 (N = 478 pharmacies), 2016 (N = 493), and 2019 (N = 494), and the CPSQG indicators were used for evaluation of the service quality. In this study, the aggregated data, collected in three study years were used to identify the implementation of guidelines into practice. For data analysis, the One-Way ANOVA test and Post-hoc multiple comparisons were used. The results demonstrated slow implementation of the CPSQG, but guidelines-based evaluation enabled a detailed overview of the community pharmacy activities and provided services. In order to develop community pharmacy services more efficiently, the use of implementation science principles, continuous introduction of the CPSQG to the pharmacists, and more active involvement of the state could be considered in the future."

This usually requires a lowering of the water level, turning a peatland from a carbon sink to a source of greenhouse gases. Thus, alternatives are sought that are less costly in both economic and ecological terms. Mass-stabilization technology can provide a cheap substitute for Portland cement. Calcareous ashes (waste materials), supplemented with pozzolanic and alkali additives to facilitate and accelerate the setting and hardening processes, are attractive alternatives to soil excavation or replacement techniques. Silica fume and waterglass were used as pozzolanic agents and KOH as a soil-alkalizing agent. X-ray fluorescence (XRF), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses and stress&strain tests were performed for the hardened samples. Crystallization of alkali feldspars was observed in all test samples. Comparable hardening of peat soil was achieved for both ashes. It was shown that the ashes of Estonian kukersite (oil shale) from both pulverized firing and a circulating fluidized bed incineration process (produced in energy sector as quantitatively major solid waste in Estonia) can be used as binding agents for peat stabilization, even without the addition of Portland cement. Hardened peat soil samples behaved as a ductile material, and the cellulose fibers naturally present in peat gave the peat&ash composite plasticity, acting mechanically in the same way as the steel or glass fiber in ordinary reinforced concrete. The effect of peat fiber reinforcement was higher in cases of higher load and displacement of the composite, making the material usable in ecological constructions."

",https://www.mdpi.com/2412-3811/9/2/24,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/infrastructures9020024,,,"Construction projects, especially those for commercial purposes, require thorough planning and control to ensure success within predetermined budgets and timelines. This research, conducted in Mashhad, Iran, employs the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and VIKOR methods to identify and rank factors influencing delays in high-rise projects. The study, based on a sample of 40 projects, emphasizes the comprehensive nature of our research method. The scale for features in project selection includes societal importance (with different applications including cultural hubs, affordable housing initiatives, and urban renewal for social equity), size (less and more than 20 units in residential projects), and diversity (mixed-use development, inclusive infrastructure, and cultural and recreational spaces), contributing to a comprehensive analysis of construction delays. Expert project managers and engineers provided insights through two questionnaires, and their responses underwent thorough analysis. Our findings not only underscore the significance of factors contributing to project success but also rank their impact on the likelihood of delays. The study reveals that the negative effects of these factors on cost, time, and project quality vary. Time emerges as the most influential parameter, with approximately six times more impact on cost and nine times more on quality. Contractor financial weakness, delays in allocating financial and credit resources, insufficient project resource allocation, contractor technical and executive weakness, and a lack of proper implementation and project control are identified as the most important factors contributing to delays."

Therefore, the use of plant powders as natural preservatives in the composition of pork and beef products could be an alternative to traditional meat products. This study aimed to assess the effect of different powders, such as blackcurrant, chokeberry, rowan berries, apple, tomato, garlic, and rhubarb, on the microbial growth dynamics in minced pork and beef during refrigerated storage. The total counts of aerobic microorganisms,Pseudomonasspp., yeasts, and molds were examined according to ISO methods. The polyphenolic profiles of plant powders and supplemented minced pork and beef samples were determined by HPLC-MS. The antioxidative capacity of the plant powders was analyzed using a spectrophotometric method. The findings of the study revealed that supplemented minced pork and beef samples had similar polyphenolic profiles and microbial growth dynamics. The highest antioxidative capacity was observed for anthocyanin-rich berry powders. In both minced pork and beef, rhubarb powder was the most effective plant material for inhibiting microbial growth, followed by blackcurrant pomace powder. In conclusion, all of the plant powders used in the present study can be used for the valorization of minced meat products, providing both antimicrobial and antioxidant effects."

Having experienced eruptive mass-loss outbursts in the 20th century, the star‚Äôs effective temperature reached record high values in the early 2000s. However, since then, the star‚Äôs behaviour has displayed an unprecedented level of stability. In spite of that, the star could be traversing through the ‚Äòyellow void‚Äô instability region.

Aims. To describe the current evolutionary state of V509 Cas, we analysed its variability using photometric and spectroscopic data collected over recent years. By comparing our findings with historical records, we aim to determine whether the star‚Äôs surface shows signs of stabilisation. Additionally, we investigate the variability of emission components in the wings of certain spectral lines to highlight the contribution of the circumstellar gaseous disc to this phenomenon.

Methods. Our spectroscopic monitoring observations were carried out at Tartu Observatory over the course of seven years, supplemented by echelle spectra obtained at the Nordic Optical Telescope, as well as publicly available photometric data from Gaia, AAVSO, and AAVSO‚Äôs Bright Star Monitor programme. We estimated the variability of effective temperature and radial velocity from the spectral time series and correlated it with the brightness variability of V509 Cas.

Results. The results indicate that the star‚Äôs average brightness level has remained stable throughout the observed period, with an amplitude of variability ‚àº0.1 mag. While the amplitude of short-term temperature fluctuations has decreased compared to the early 2000s, the variability of the radial velocity remains similar to historical values from the early 20th century. Moreover, we show how the variable radial velocity affects the emission components in some absorption lines (e.g. Sc‚ÄØII) and how that follows the hypothesis of a disc surrounding the star."

However, the extent to which TDD improves quality appears to be largely dependent upon the characteristics of the study in which it is evaluated (e.g., the research method, participant type, programming environment, etc.). The particularities of each study make the aggregation of results untenable.Objectives:The goal of this paper is to: increase the accuracy and generalizability of the results achieved in isolated experiments on TDD, provide joint conclusions on the performance of TDD across different industrial and academic settings, and assess the extent to which the characteristics of the experiments affect the quality-related performance of TDD.Method:We conduct a family of 12 experiments on TDD in academia and industry. We aggregate their results by means of meta-analysis. We perform exploratory analyses to identify variables impacting the quality-related performance of TDD.Results:TDD novices achieve a slightly higher code quality with iterative test-last development (i.e., ITL, the reverse approach of TDD) than with TDD. The task being developed largely determines quality. The programming environment, the order in which TDD and ITL are applied, or the learning effects from one development approach to another do not appear to affect quality. The quality-related performance of professionals using TDD drops more than for students. We hypothesize that this may be due to their being more resistant to change and potentially less motivated than students.Previous studies seem to provide conflicting results on TDD performance (i.e., positive vs. negative, respectively). We hypothesize that these conflicting results may be due to different study durations, experiment participants being unfamiliar with the TDD process, or case studies comparing the performance achieved by TDD vs. the control approach (e.g., the waterfall model), each applied to develop a different system. Further experiments with TDD experts are needed to validate these hypotheses."

However, forest herbs differ in their life histories, and landscapes have different environments, structures and histories, making generalizations difficult.ObjectivesWe compare the response of three slow-colonizing forest herbs to habitat loss and fragmentation and set this in relation to differences in life-history traits, in particular their mating system and associated pollinators.MethodsWe analysed the herbs' landscape-scale population genetic structure based on microsatellite markers from replicate forest fragments across seven European agricultural landscapes.ResultsAll species responded to reductions in population size with a decrease in allelic richness and an increase in genetic differentiation among populations. Genetic differentiation also increased with enhanced spatial isolation. In addition, each species showed unique responses. Heterozygosity in the self-compatibleOxalis acetosellawas reduced in smaller populations. The genetic diversity ofAnemone nemorosa, whose main pollinators are less mobile, decreased with increasing spatial isolation, but not that of the bumblebee-pollinatedPolygonatum multiflorum.ConclusionsOur study indicates that habitat loss and fragmentation compromise the long-term viability of slow-colonizing forest herbs despite their ability to persist for many decades by clonal propagation. The distinct responses of the three species studied within the same landscapes confirm the need of multi-species approaches. The mobility of associated pollinators should be considered an important determinant of forest herbs' sensitivity to habitat loss and fragmentation."

However, little is known about how the interactions of seed and pollen dispersers with the agricultural matrix translate into gene flow among plant populations.ObjectivesWe aimed to identify effects of the landscape structure on the genetic diversity within, and the genetic differentiation among, spatially isolated populations of three temperate forest herbs. We asked, whether different arable crops have different effects, and whether the orientation of linear landscape elements relative to the gene dispersal direction matters.MethodsWe analysed the species' population genetic structures in seven agricultural landscapes across temperate Europe using microsatellite markers. These were modelled as a function of landscape composition and configuration, which we quantified in buffer zones around, and in rectangular landscape strips between, plant populations.ResultsLandscape effects were diverse and often contrasting between species, reflecting their association with different pollen- or seed dispersal vectors. Differentiating crop types rather than lumping them together yielded higher proportions of explained variation. Some linear landscape elements had both a channelling and hampering effect on gene flow, depending on their orientation.ConclusionsLandscape structure is a more important determinant of the species' population genetic structure than habitat loss and fragmentation per se. Landscape planning with the aim to enhance the functional connectivity among spatially isolated plant populations should consider that even species of the same ecological guild might show distinct responses to the landscape structure."

We study the effects of this reform on the students' access to and progress in higher education, concentrating mostly on the changes in probabilities of rural and remote students being admitted (extensive margin) and graduating within a nominal time (intensive margin). We distinguish between four different outcomes: admission in general, admission to vocational education, admission to high-rank curricula, and graduation within nominal time. We confirm the tendency that a high socioeconomic status increases the probability of being admitted to high-rank curricula and reduces the probability of choosing an applied curriculum, and the 2013 reform did not change that. While the reform weakly improved rural students' tendency to graduate on time, it diminished the probability that they were admitted to high-rank curricula. So, paradoxically and contrary to the intention of the reform, higher state involvement in higher education financing has not improved the equity in university admission in Estonia in terms of either socioeconomic background or regional disparities. We claim that part of the explanation of that paradox lies in the conditionality of this reform and the combination of a scarce needs-based and a competitive merit-based student support system in Estonia. We see our broader contribution in emphasising the important role of support systems in the future analysis of the potential to improve students' access."

The objective of this paper is to provide a methodological framework for analysing the economic performance of selected blue sectors, suggesting additional information for the development of cross-border cooperation in two neighbouring countries: Estonia and Finland. The analysis of the economic performance of the selected blue sectors relies on the Amadeus database for both countries, the implementation of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), and the calculation of partial productivity measures. The results of the study show that, on average, blue sectors report good performance indicators in coastal regions, but there are also some signs of imperfect efficiency. The common pattern of imperfectly efficient blue sectors in both countries is due to an excess of some fixed assets, which convey extra costs for business activities and, to some extent, generate excessive environmental pressures. The special nature of a shared blue economic area between Estonia and Finland stipulates close cross-border cooperation as an important tool to improve the performance of the imperfectly efficient sectors through shared √¢‚Ç¨≈ìbest practice√¢‚Ç¨¬ù operations, technologies, and infrastructures. However, the lack of appropriate cross-border statistical data restricts analytical opportunities and the development of policy recommendations."

Cucurbitacins may be a potential choice for investigations of synergism with other drugs to reverse cancer cells' treatment resistance. The detailed molecular mechanisms underlying these effects include interactions between cucurbitacins and numerous cellular targets (Bcl-2/Bax, caspases, STAT3, cyclins, NF-√é¬∫B, COX-2, MMP-9, VEGF/R, etc.) as well as control of a variety of intracellular signal transduction pathways.

A cybersecurity expert has an in-depth knowledge of technology but is often also recognized for the ability to view technology in a non-standard way. This paper explores how CS specialists are both a combination of professional computing-based skills and genetically encoded traits. Almost every human behavioral trait is a result of many genome variants in action altogether with environmental factors. The review focuses on contextualizing the behavior genetics aspects in the application of cybersecurity. It reconsiders methods that help to identify aspects of human behavior from the genetic information. And stress is an illustrative factor to start the discussion within the community on what methodology should be used in an ethical way to approach those questions. CS positions are considered stressful due to the complexity of the domain and the social impact it can have in cases of failure. An individual risk profile could be created combining known genome variants linked to a trait of particular behavior using a special biostatistical approach such as a polygenic score. These revised advancements bring challenging possibilities in the applications of human behavior genetics and CS.

According to the unified model of CDK function, the cell cycle is coordinated by CDK both via general CDK activity thresholds and cyclin-specific substrate docking. Recently, it was found that the G1-cyclins ofS. cerevisiaehave a specific function in promoting polarization and growth of the buds, making the G1 cyclins essential for cell survival. Thus, while a uniform CDK specificity of a single cyclin can be sufficient to drive the cell cycle in some cells, such as in fission yeast, cyclin specificity can be essential in other organisms. However, the known G1-CDK specific LP docking motif, was not responsible for this essential function, indicating that G1-CDKs use yet other unknown docking mechanisms. Here we report a discovery of a G1 cyclin-specific (Cln1,2) lysine-arginine-rich helical docking motif (the K/R motif) in G1-CDK targets involved in the mating pathway (Ste7), transcription (Xbp1), bud morphogenesis (Bud2) and spindle pole body (Spc29, Spc42, Spc110, Sli15) function ofS. cerevisiae. We also show that the docking efficiency of K/R motif can be regulated by basophilic kinases such as protein kinase A. Our results further widen the list of cyclin specificity mechanisms and may explain the recently demonstrated unique essential function of G1 cyclins in budding yeast."

They are formulated in terms of a modified dispersion relation and a modified momentum conservation equation. In this work we use Finsler geometry to formulate deformed relativistic kinematics in terms of particle velocities. The relation between the Finsler geometric velocity dependent formulation and the original momentum dependent formulation allows us to construct deformed Lorentz transformations between arbitrary frames. Moreover, we find the corresponding compatible momentum conservation equation to first order in the Planck scale deformation of special relativity based on the√é¬∫-Poincar√É¬© algebra in the bicrossproduct basis. We find that the deformed Lorentz transformations, as well as the deformed time dilation factor, contain terms that scale with the energy of the particle under consideration to the fourth power. We derive how the distributions of decay products are affected when the deformed relativity principle is satisfied and find, for the case of a pion decaying into a neutrino and a muon, that the ratio of expected neutrinos to muons with a certain energy is just slightly modified when compared to the predictions based on special relativity. We also discuss the phenomenological consequences of this framework for cosmic-ray showers in the atmosphere."

",https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/20/17/4842,http://doi.org/10.3390/s20174842,,,"Deployment of efficient and cost-effective parking lots is a known bottleneck for the electric vehicles (EVs) sector. A comprehensive solution incorporating the requirements of all key stakeholders is required. Taking up the challenge, we propose a real-time EV smart parking lot model to attain the following objectives: (a) maximize the smart parking lot revenue by accommodating maximum number of EVs and (b) minimize the cost of power consumption by participating in a demand response (DR) program offered by the utility since it is a tool to answer and handle the electric power usage requirements for charging the EV in the smart parking lot. With a view to achieving these objectives, a linear programming-based binary/cyclic (0/1) optimization technique is developed for the EV charge scheduling process. It is difficult to solve the problems of binary optimization in real-time given that the complexity of the problem increases with the increase in number of EV. We deploy a simplified convex relaxation technique integrated with the linear programming solution to overcome this problem. The algorithm achieves: minimum power consumption cost of the EV smart parking lot; efficient utilization of available power; maximization of the number of the EV to be charged; and minimum impact on the EV battery lifecycle. DR participation provide benefits by offering time-based and incentive-based hourly intelligent charging schedules for the EV. A thorough comparison is drawn with existing variable charging rate-based techniques in order to demonstrate the comparative validity of our proposed technique. The simulation results show that even under no DR event, the proposed scheme results in 2.9% decrease in overall power consumption cost for a 500 EV scenario when compared to variable charging rate method. Moreover, in similar conditions, such as no DR event and for 500 EV arrived per day, there is a 2.8% increase in number of EV charged per day, 3.2% improvement in the average state-of-charge (SoC) of the EV, 12.47% reduction in the average time intervals required to achieve final SoC."

To raise awareness of these problems, this research aims at determining whether the long-lasting effects of depression can be determined from electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. The article contains an accuracy comparison for SVM, LDA, NB, kNN, and D3 binary classifiers, which were trained using linear (relative band power, alpha power variability, spectral asymmetry index) and nonlinear (Higuchi fractal dimension, Lempel&Ziv complexity, detrended fluctuation analysis) EEG features. The age- and gender-matched dataset consisted of 10 healthy subjects and 10 subjects diagnosed with depression at some point in their lifetime. Most of the proposed feature selection and classifier combinations achieved accuracy in the range of 80% to 95%, and all the models were evaluated using a 10-fold cross-validation. The results showed that the motioned EEG features used in classifying ongoing depression also work for classifying the long-lasting effects of depression."

Aging is affected by various aggravating factors, mainly temperature. There are many electric or electrochemical models which describe their operation. Most standard models do not consider the aging phenomena of batteries and their consequences, while batteries deteriorate when used or stored. Precisely, most battery models do not simulate the influence of cell aging on other cells. The model presented in this paper incorporates aging and the effects of mutual interactions between cells. The model can be established based on four measurement points on the cell characteristic curve and allows the simulation of a single cell's or multiple coupled cells' behavior. The model can then be easily implemented in simulation software like Matlab."

To address this shortcoming, an open-source tool calledArchetypeBuildingModel.jlhas been developed for aggregating building-stock-level data into simplified lumped-capacitance thermal models compatible with existing open-source energy-system modelling frameworks. This paper aims to demonstrate the feasibility of these simplified thermal models by comparing their performance against dedicated building simulation software, as well as examining their sensitivity to key modelling and parameter assumptions. Modelling and parameter assumptions comparable to the existing literature achieved an acceptable performance according to ASHRAE Guideline 14 across all tested buildings and nodal configurations. The most robust performance was achieved with a period of variations above 13 days and interior node depth between 0.1 and 0.2 for structural thermal mass calibrations, and with external shading coefficients between 0.6 and 1.0 and solar heat gain convective fractions between 0.4 and 0.6 for solar heat gain calibrations. Furthermore, three-plus-node lumped-capacitance thermal models are recommended when modelling buildings with structures varying in terms of thermal mass. Nevertheless, theArchetypeBuildingModel.jlperformance was found to be robust against uncertain key parameter assumptions, making it plausible for energy-market-scale applications."

Additionally, these neighboring regions show significant variance in the total number of deaths caused by the coronavirus. The higher value of the total number of deaths in the Baltic states is explained by a higher number of COVID-19 cases, a relatively lower value of GDP per capita, a higher share of elderly citizens, and what might be the essential factor ‚Äî a lower level of trust by citizens in their national governments. The general conclusion is that the effectiveness of coronavirus policies is undermined by an absence of trust in governmental decision-making.

Consequently, the reduction of P load is an urgent need to solve, but the complexity of both the environmental and legislative context of the area makes this process difficult (more than in the past). Eutrophication is an intricate issue requiring a proper framework of governance that is not easy to determine in the Baltic Sea Region where the needs of several different countries converge. To identify the most suitable strategy to reduce the eutrophication in the Baltic Sea, the InPhos project (no. 17022, 2018&2019, funded by the European Institute of Innovation & Technology (EIT) Raw Materials) adopted a holistic approach considering technical, political, economic, environmental and social aspects of P management. With the aims to raise awareness about the P challenge, foster the dialogue among all the stakeholders, and find solutions already developed in other countries (such as Germany and Switzerland) to be transferred in the Baltic Sea Region, the InPhos project consortium applied the methodology proposed in this paper, consisting of three main phases: (i) analysis of the available technologies to remove P from waste streams that contribute to eutrophication; (ii) analysis of the main streams involving P in Baltic Sea countries to highlight the potential of more sustainable and circular P management; (iii) study of the current context (e.g., already-existing initiatives and issues). This approach allowed us to identify four categories of recommendations and practical actions proposed to improve P management in the Baltic Sea region. During the project, the consortium mainly addressed social aspects. Following steps beyond the project will be more quantitative to determine the techno-economic feasibility of circular P management in selected demo cases in the region."

Food prepared from meat and fish is the main source of these substances in the human diet, and it is extremely important to implement storage and processing techniques ensuring their maximum preservation and even accumulation during maturation or conditioning. In experiments with freshly refrigerated grass carp and defrosted Alaska pollock fillets it was discovered, initially using Fast Protein and Metabolites Liquid Chromatography and the ATP-bioluminescence test, and afterwards validated by NMR spectroscopy, that heat treatment identical to conventional culinary processing in aqueous or wet media at temperatures above 62 √Ç¬∞C leads to nucleotide salvage (recovery) in aged fish. A significant increase in the concentration of IMP, and even an emergence of ANP substances, were reliably demonstrated in fish samples which had already partially or fully lost these components during prolonged storage due to the ATP breakdown metabolic reactions. Owing to this recovery, the nutritive value of ready-to-eat food can be higher than was initially evaluated in raw products before heat treatment: an effect that should certainly be considered in practical nutrition. Moreover, it is necessary to reconsider the widely acknowledged system of indices of freshness based on nucleotides and nucleosides elaborated a long time ago for raw meat and fish products."

This creates distinctive biota in freshwater and brackish water (mesohaline) environments. To test how saline boundaries influence the diversity and composition of host-associated microbiota, we analyzed the microbiome within the digestive tract ofTheodoxus fluviatilis, an organism able to cross the freshwater and mesohaline boundary. Alpha-diversity measures of the microbiome in freshwater and brackish water were not significantly different. However, the composition of the bacterial community within freshwaterT. fluviatilisdiffered significantly compared with mesohalineT. fluviatilisand typical bacteria could be determined for the freshwater and the mesohaline digestive tract microbiome. An artificial increase in salinity surrounding these freshwater snails resulted in a strong change in the bacterial community and typical marine bacteria became more pronounced in the digestive tract microbiome of freshwaterT. fluviatilis. However, the composition of the digestive tract microbiome in freshwater snails did not converge to that found within mesohaline snails. Within mesohaline snails, no cardinal change was found after either an increase or decrease in salinity. In all samples,Pseudomonas,Pirellula,Flavobacterium,Limnohabitans, andAcinetobacterwere among the most abundant bacteria. These bacterial genera were largely unaffected by changes in environmental conditions. As permanent residents inT. fluviatilis, they may support the digestion of the algal food in the digestive tract. Our results show that freshwater and mesohaline water host-associated microbiomes respond differently to changes in salinity. Therefore, the salinization of coastal freshwater environments due to a rise in sea level can influence the gut microbiome and its functions with currently unknown consequences for, e.g., nutritional physiology of the host."

The purpose of this study was to extend the knowledge of distinct coping strategies under challenging events in two differently adapting mouse strains: C57BL/6NTac (Bl6) and 129S6/SvEvTac (129Sv). Thus, we aimed to investigate possible similarities and differences in the body weight change, behavior, and several metabolic variables in Bl6 and 129Sv strains in response to high-fat diet (HFD) using the AbsoluteIDQ p180 kit. We found that 9 weeks of HFD induced a significant body weight gain in 129Sv, but not in Bl6 mice. Besides that, 129Sv mice displayed anxiety-like behavior in the open-field test. Metabolite profiling revealed that 129Sv mice had higher levels of circulating branched-chain amino acids, which were even more amplified by HFD. HFD also induced a decrease in glycine, spermidine, and t4-OH-proline levels in 129Sv mice. Although acylcarnitines (ACs) dominated in baseline conditions in 129Sv strain, this strain had a significantly stronger AC-reducing effect of HFD. Moreover, 129Sv mice had higher levels of lipids in baseline conditions, but HFD caused more pronounced alterations in lipid profile in Bl6 mice. Taken together, our results show that the Bl6 line is better adapted to abundant fat intake."

By simulating the behavior of physical turbines in real time, DTs enable operators to predict potential failures and optimize maintenance schedules, resulting in increased reliability, safety, and efficiency. WTGs rely on accurate wind speed measurements for safe and efficient operation. However, physical wind speed sensors are prone to inaccuracies and failures due to environmental factors or inherent issues, resulting in partial or missing measurements that can affect the turbine's performance. This paper proposes a DT-based sensing methodology to overcome these limitations by augmenting the physical sensor platform with virtual sensor arrays. A test bench of a direct drive WTG based on a permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) was prepared, and its mathematical model was derived. MATLAB/Simulink was used to develop the WTG virtual model based on its mathematical model. A data acquisition system (DAS) equipped with an ActiveX server was used to facilitate real-time data exchange between the virtual and physical models. The virtual sensor was then validated and tuned using real sensory data from the physical turbine model. The results from the developed DT model showed the power of the DT as a virtual sensor in estimating wind speed according to the generated power."

Building Information Modelling (BIM) offers opportunities to address some of the current challenges through BIM-enabled education and training. This research defines the requisite characteristics of a BIM-enabled Learning Environment (BLE): a web-based platform that facilitates BIM-enabled education and training: in order to develop a prototype version of the BLE. Using a mixed-methods research design and an Adaptive Structuration Theory (AST) perspective for interpreting the findings, 33 features and 5 distinct intentions behind those features were identified. These findings are valuable in taking forward the development of the BLE as they suggest a BLE requires the integration of functions from three existing types of information technology application (virtual learning environments, virtual collaboration platforms, and BIM applications). This study will inform the design of a web-based BLE for enhanced AEC-FM education and training, and it also provides a starting point for researchers to apply AST to evaluate the use of a BLE in different educational and training contexts."

In this study, the genetic structure of the European and western AsianD. sapineapopulation were investigated using 13 microsatellite markers. In total, 425 isolates from 15 countries were analysed. A high clonal fraction and low genetic distance between most subpopulations was found. One single haplotype dominates the European population, being represented by 45.3% of all isolates and found in nearly all investigated countries. Three genetically distinct subpopulations were found: Central/North European, Italian and Georgian. The recently detected subpopulations ofD. sapineain northern Europe (Estonia) share several haplotypes with the German subpopulation. The northern European subpopulations (Latvia, Estonia and Finland) show relatively high genetic diversity compared to those in central Europe suggesting either that the fungus has existed in the North in an asymptomatic/endophytic mode for a long time or that it has spread recently by multiple introductions. Considerable genetic diversity was found even among isolates of a single tree as 16 isolates from a single tree resulted in lower clonal fraction index than most subpopulations in Europe, which might reflect cryptic sexual proliferation. According to currently published allelic patterns,D. sapineamost likely originates from North America or from some unsampled population in Asia or central America. In order to enable the detection of endophytic or latent infections of planting stock byD. sapinea, new species-specific PCR primers (DiSapi-F and Diplo-R) were designed. During the search forDiplodiaisolates across the world for species specific primer development, we identifiedD. africanain California, USA, and in the Canary Islands, which are the first records of this species in North America and in Spain."

Decline in the sea water oxygen concentration is considered to be an effect of eutrophication, also exacerbated by climate change. The Baltic Sea is one of the most eutrophic seas in the world and is located in northern Europe. It is a vulnerable, brackish, semi-enclosed sea, suffering from high pressures from human activity. This leads to increased hypoxic and anoxic areas, which can be used as a measure of the environmental state. In the present study the extent of anoxic (O2< 0 ml l&1) and hypoxic (O2< 2 ml l&1) areas were estimated for the autumns in 1960&2019 using vertical profiles of observed oxygen concentrations in the Baltic proper and four sub-areas of the Baltic proper: the Bornholm Basin, the western, northern and eastern Gotland basins. From vertical profiles of observed salinity, the annual average of the halocline depths in the four sub-basins were estimated. The results imply regime shifts toward increased anoxic area extents in the Gotland basins around the turn of the 20th century. In autumn 2018, the extent of anoxic bottom areas in the Baltic Sea was record high since the start of the data series. During the later part of the studied period the depths of the halocline coincide with the depth of the hypoxia in the Gotland basins. This implies that in these basins a worst-case scenario for the extent of hypoxic areas seems to be reached."

The Storegga Event, which triggered a tsunami reflected in sediment deposits in the northern North Sea, northeast coastlines of the British Isles and across the North Atlantic, was a major event during this transgressive phase. The spatial extent of the Storegga tsunami however remains unconfirmed as, to date, no direct evidence for the event has been recovered from the southern North Sea. We present evidence of a tsunami deposit in the southern North Sea at the head of a palaeo-river system that has been identified using seismic survey. The evidence, based on lithostratigraphy, geochemical signatures, macro and microfossils and sedimentary ancient DNA (sedaDNA), supported by optical stimulated luminescence (OSL) and radiocarbon dating, suggests that these deposits were a result of the tsunami. Seismic identification of this stratum and analysis of adjacent cores showed diminished traces of the tsunami which was largely removed by subsequent erosional processes. Our results confirm previous modelling of the impact of the tsunami within this area of the southern North Sea, and also indicate that these effects were temporary, localized, and mitigated by the dense woodland and topography of the area. We conclude that clear physical remnants of the wave in these areas are likely to be restricted to now buried, palaeo-inland basins and incised river valley systems."

To reach nZEB or low energy building targets (renovation cases) we should take these losses into account during the design phase. These losses depend on room and water temperature, insulation and length of pipes and water circulation strategy. The target of our study is to develop a method which can be used in the early stages of design in primary energy calculations. We are also interested in how much of these losses cannot be utilised as internal heat gain and how much heat loss depends on the level of energy performance of the building. We used detailed DHW system heat loss measurements and simulations from an nZEB apartment building and annual heat loss data from a total of 22 apartment buildings. Our study showed that EN 15316-3 standard equations for pipe length give more than a twice the pipe length in basements. We recommend that for pipe length calculation in basements, a calculation based on the building's gross area should be used and for pipe length in vertical shafts, a building's heating area-based calculation should be used. Our study also showed that up to 33% of pipe heat losses can be utilised as internal heat gain in energy renovated apartment buildings but in unheated basements this figure drops to 30% and in shafts rises to 40% for an average loss (thermal pipe insulation thickness 40 mm) of 10.8 W/m and 5.1 W/m. Unutilised delivered energy loss from DHW systems in smaller apartment buildings can be up to 12.1 kWh/(m2√Ç¬∑a) and in bigger apartment buildings not less than 5.5 kWh/(m2√Ç¬∑a) (40 mm thermal pipe insulation)."

This comprehensive global population study elucidated the historical migration pathways of the pathogen to reveal the Eurasian origin of the fungus. When over 3800 isolates were examined, three major population clusters were revealed: North America, Western Europe, and Eastern Europe, with distinct subclusters in the highly diverse Eastern European cluster. Modeling of historical scenarios using approximate Bayesian computation revealed the North American cluster was derived from an ancestral population in Eurasia. The Northeastern European subcluster was shown to be ancestral to all other European clusters and subclusters. The Turkish subcluster diverged first, followed by the Central European subcluster, then the Western European cluster, which has subsequently spread to much of the Southern Hemisphere. All clusters and subclusters contained both mating-types of the fungus, indicating the potential for sexual reproduction, although asexual reproduction remained the primary mode of reproduction. The study strongly suggests the native range ofD. septosporumto be in Eastern Europe (i.e., the Baltic and Western Russia) and Western Asia."

The hardness and elastic modulus of the stacks depended on the order of the constituent oxide films, reaching 15 and 171 GPa, respectively, in the case of top SnO2layers. Nonlinear saturative magnetization could be induced in the stacks with coercive fields up to 130 Oe."

With a carbohydrate content nearly equivalent to corn but at a lower price, it has potential as an energy-generating feed, especially in poultry farming. The nutrient content and price of dried rice were evaluated to assess its efficiency for animal feed use. Dried rice samples from three areas in East Java, Indonesia, were analyzed for moisture, ash, crude protein, crude fat, and crude fiber content. Additionally, this research assesses the effectiveness of dried rice as a corn substitute in broiler feed by observing its impact on feed intake, average daily gain, feed conversion ratio, and broiler performance index. Proximate analysis showed insignificant differences among treatments, with moisture content ranging 12.45&12.71%, ash content 0.55&1.31%, crude protein 10.34&10.64%, crude fat 0.12&2.48%, and crude fiber from 0.81 to 1.55%. Although all samples were assessed as efficient, products from Lumajang and Pasuruan were preferred for feed production due to their similarity to corn nutrient content. Dried rice costs approximately USD 213&228 per ton, significantly lower than corn. Dried rice production reduces both organic waste and poultry production costs concurrently, serving as a sustainable waste management model in Indonesia and other rice-producing countries, shifting towards a bioeconomy from a linear economy."

However, plant-associated bacteria, fungi, and viruses can enhance stress resistance and cope with the negative impacts of drought through the induction of various mechanisms, which involve plant biochemical and physiological changes. These mechanisms include osmotic adjustment, antioxidant enzyme enhancement, modification in phytohormonal levels, biofilm production, increased water and nutrient uptake as well as increased gas exchange and water use efficiency. Production of microbial volatile organic compounds (mVOCs) and induction of stress-responsive genes by microbes also play a crucial role in the acquisition of drought tolerance. This review offers a unique exploration of the role of plant-associated microorganisms: plant growth promoting rhizobacteria and mycorrhizae, viruses, and their interactions: in the plant microbiome (or phytobiome) as a whole and their modes of action that mitigate plant drought stress."

Compared to chemotherapy, quercetin, a flavonoid, is relatively less harmful to normal cells and is regarded as an excellent free-radical scavenger. Apoptotic cell death of cancer cells caused by quercetin has been demonstrated by many prior studies. It is present in many fruits, vegetables, and herbs. Quercetin targets apoptosis, by upregulating Bax, caspase-3, and p21 while downregulating Akt, PLK-1, cyclin-B1, cyclin-A, CDC-2, CDK-2, and Bcl-2. Additionally, it has been reported to increase STAT3 protein degradation in liver cancer cells while decreasing STAT3 activation. Quercetin has a potential future in chemoprevention, based on substantial research on its anticancer effects. The current review discusses quercetin's mechanisms of action, nanodelivery strategies, and other potential cellular effects in liver cancer."

The inherent disturbance rejection capacity of classical closed loop control systems is limited, and an increase in disturbance rejection performance of single-loop control systems affects the set-point control performance. Multi-loop control structures, which involve model reference control loops, can enhance the inherent disturbance rejection capacity of classical control loops without degrading set-point control performance; while the classical closed Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) control loop deals with stability and set-point control, the additional model reference control loop performs disturbance rejection control. This adaptive disturbance rejection, which does not influence set-point control performance, is achieved by selecting reference models as transfer functions of real control systems. This study investigates six types of multi-loop model reference (ML-MR) control structures for PID control loops and presents straightforward design schemes to enhance the disturbance rejection control performance of existing PID control loops. For this purpose, linear and non-linear ML-MR control structures are introduced, and their control performance improvements and certain inherent drawbacks of these structures are discussed. Design examples demonstrate the benefits of the ML-MR control structures for disturbance rejection performance improvement of PID control loops without severely deteriorating their set-point performance."

Here, we shed light on the role of sweat glands in the DC pathogenesis by proteomic analysis and immunofluorescence microscopy. We demonstrated that a fraction of sweat gland epithelium underwent epithelial-mesenchymal transition illustrated by negative regulation of E-cadherin. We hypothesized that the increase in connective tissue growth factor expression in DC sweat glands has both autocrine and paracrine effects in sustaining the DC formation and inducing pathological changes in DC-associated sweat glands."

To date, a few reports have been published that raise the possibility of new onset myasthenia gravis (MG) associated with COVID-19 infection. We report a case of a 65-year-old male who developed his initial myasthenic presentation with mild dysarthria 14 days after COVID-19 infection symptomatic onset. His bulbar symptoms, diplopia, and ptosis progressed considerably over the next 1.5 months before he was diagnosed with non-thymomatous MG. Serological tests showed a high concentration of anti-acetylcholine receptor and anti-titin antibodies. He responded well to treatment with pyridostigmine and intravenous immunoglobulin. Reasonable latency from COVID-19 infection and gradual evolvement of myasthenic symptoms makes the causative association probable in this case. To our knowledge, this is the first report of anti-titin antibodies in new-onset MG associated with COVID-19 infection. In the article, we analyze the previously reported cases and summarize the information published to date. We discuss the possible immunological mechanisms behind new onset autoimmune disease following a viral infection and the associated features that raise the suspicion for such a possibility. We also hint at structural homologies between SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein and titin epitopes."

Due to their merits of being selective, stable, simple, and having a low preparation cost, molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are increasingly becoming artificial substitutes for natural receptors in the design of state-of-the-art sensing devices. While there are different MIP preparation approaches, electrochemical synthesis presents a unique and outstanding method for chemical sensing applications, allowing the direct formation of the polymer on the transducer as well as simplicity in tuning the film properties, thus accelerating the trend in the design of commercial MIP-based sensors. This review evaluates recent achievements in the applications of electrosynthesized MIP sensors for clinical analysis of disease biomarkers, identifying major trends and highlighting interesting perspectives on the realization of commercial MIP-endowed testing devices for rapid determination of prevailing diseases."

A mixed method study design was used, including quantitative and qualitative content analysis of 872 messages posted by members of the Facebook group, which were divided into eight role groups. Teachers, educational technologists, principals and parents represented local stakeholders while external stakeholders included members from government institutions, supporters, teacher educators and members with other roles. The analysis covered activeness of each role group, emotional expressions, speech acts and topics represented in messages. The results indicate that educational technologists played a key role in handling the coronavirus pandemic situation in education. However, local stakeholders also received support from external stakeholders. The results help capture the roles, experiences and views of different stakeholders during the educational change caused by the coronavirus pandemic in order to learn from this and to be prepared for such situations in the future."

We adopted a quasi-experiment comparative research design involving 100 ninth-grade students (13&14√Ç¬†years old). We collected data through achievement tests and perception questionnaires and analyzed them using Cochran's Q-test, Mann&WhitneyU-test, and independent samples t-test. Results show that the group in which II was used performed better than those from the group where DI was used. Also, the results show that girls performed better with DI than boys. Furthermore, students perceived ER as useful for developing collaboration and interest in STEM. Therefore, teachers should be supported in learning how to use II and DI strategically in ER to enhance STEM learning."

However, the lack of familiarity of therapists with the technologies involved makes their widespread introduction difficult and leads to case-specific rather than more generalizable methods. In this paper, we present an experimental methodology which provides a guide for the introduction of these elements in therapeutical activities with children with NDD. Providing a common framework reduces the gap between the different expertise of therapists, educators, and engineers. While establishing a common vocabulary and objectives, the methodology provides a guide for designing activities and evaluating their therapeutic effectiveness. We provide an example with a pilot study using a low-cost robot (Ozobot) in a therapeutic environment. Results regarding the children's task involvement, level of attention, and use of social skills were positive. In addition, the attitude of some children changed throughout the sessions, improving frustration tolerance. The discussion of the pilot study provides clues for improving future implementations of the presented methodology, which serves as a framework for the design of future experiments that include therapeutic activities with educational robotics, gamification, and storytelling."

The purpose of this research is to provide decision-makers with an extensive array of criteria and indicators, enabling informed decision-making, policy formulation, and impact assessment tailored to the distinctive attributes encountered in European destinations. Based on the synthesis of existing approaches, and in co-creation with 21 European tourism destinations, an indicator-based framework is proposed, structured around the environmental, economic, social, cultural, resilience, and characterization domains. The results are particularly novel in the resilience and cultural domains, related to the recovery from crisis impacts, but also to the enhancement of digital approaches, as well as the preservation and promotion of cultural heritage towards a more hospitable destination. Moreover, the involvement of stakeholders incorporating real-case scenarios allows this research to bridge the gap between theoretical constructs and practical application. The indicator-based framework resulting from this research will provide stakeholders with assistance in assessing and comparing the impacts of cultural tourism on their destinations and, thence, help them acquire knowledge on cultural resource management, contributing to a more sustainable, responsible, and balanced impact."

The realistic facial behavior of social robots and artificial agents is still a challenge, limiting their emotional credibility in dyadic face-to-face situations with humans. One obstacle is the lack of appropriate training data on how humans typically interact in such settings. This article focused on collecting the facial behavior of 60 participants to createa new type of dyadic emotion reaction database. For this purpose, we propose a methodology that automatically captures the facial expressions of participants via webcam while they are engaged with other people (facial videos) in emotionally primed contexts. The data were then analyzed using three different Facial Expression Analysis (FEA) tools: iMotions, the Mini-Xception model, and the Py-Feat FEA toolkit. Although the emotion reactions were reported as genuine, the comparative analysis between the aforementioned models could not agree with a single emotion reaction prediction. Based on this result, a more-robust and -effective model for emotion reaction prediction is needed. The relevance of this work for human&computer interaction studies lies in its novel approach to developing adaptive behaviors for synthetic human-like beings (virtual or robotic), allowing them to simulate human facial interaction behavior in contextually varying dyadic situations with humans. This article should be useful for researchers using human emotion analysis while deciding on a suitable methodology to collect facial expression reactions in a dyadic setting."

Between these two time frames, we also have a mid-term forecasting time frame, that of a few years ahead. Investigations here are aimed at policy support, although in a more mid-term horizon, we address issues such as investment planning and pricing. In this paper, we develop and evaluate statistical and neural network approaches for this mid-term forecasting of final energy and electricity for the residential sector in six EU countries (Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Spain, Portugal and Greece). Various possible approaches to model the explanatory variables used are presented, discussed, and assessed as to their suitability.

Since the traditional mechanical and hybrid circuit breakers for dc fault protection have the drawback of slow operation, a solid-state circuit breaker (SSCB) is an optimal solution for fast dc fault interruption. In this paper, a dc SSCB is proposed that uses an RCD + MOV snubber circuit, which is considered the best and most complete circuit used in common SSCBs. There are two main contributions in this paper: First, a dc SSCB is designed, which isolates both positive and negative terminals of a circuit and its working principle and operating modes along with the formulas for calculation of crucial time intervals, voltages, and currents along with the design procedure are provided. Second, a soft turn-on auxiliary is designed to prevent a high current surge caused by the capacitance difference between the source and the load.

Driver-to-driver communication channels as much as car-to-driver human&machine interfaces (HMI) are well established and part of normal training and experience. The situation is different when users must cope with driverless and autonomous vehicles, both as passengers and as agents sharing the same urban domain. This research focuses on the new challenges of connected driverless vehicles, investigating an emerging topic, namely the language of driving (LoD) between these machines and humans participating in traffic scenarios. This work presents the results of a field study conducted at Tallinn University Technology campus with the ISEAUTO autonomous driving shuttle, including interviews with 176 subjects communicating using LoD. Furthermore, this study combines expert focus group interviews to build a joint base of needs and requirements for AVs in public spaces. Based on previous studies and questionnaire results, we established the hypotheses that we can enhance physical survey results using experimental scenarios with VR/AR tools to allow the fast prototyping of different external and internal HMIs, facilitating the assessment of communication efficacy, evaluation of usability, and impact on the users. The aim is to point out how we can enhance AV design and LoD communications using XR tools. The scenarios were chosen to be inclusive and support the needs of different demographics while at the same time determining the limitations of surveys and real-world experimental scenarios in LoD testing and design for future pilots."

Whereas the total energy reserves ofA. balthicawere unaffected by an increase of salinity to 3, a high mortality rate was detected after a shift from freshwater to salinity 6 suggesting a major disruption of energy homeostasis. The shift to salinity 6 also caused a change in the gastrointestinal bacterial community composition. At salinity 3, the bacterial community composition of different host individuals was related either to the freshwater or salinity 6 gastrointestinal bacterial community, indicating an ambivalent nature of salinity 3. Since salinity 3 represents the range where aquatic gastropods are able to regulate their osmolarity, this may be an important tipping point during salinization. The change in the intestinal microbiome was uncoupled from the change in the water bacterial community and unrelated to the food source microbiome. Our study shows that environmental disturbance caused by salinity acts also on the host-protected microbiome. In light of the sea-level rise, our findings indicate that salinization of the near-shore freshwater bodies will cause changes in organisms' intestinal microbiomes if a critical salinity threshold (presumably √¢ÀÜ¬º3) is exceeded."

The work revealed that it is possible to find a moss species that is common in Tallinn and grows in both polluted and less polluted areas ‚Äì Syntrichia ruralis, which is the most suitable species for bioindication based on this work. Moss species Ceratodon purpureus accumulated the most Cd, Cu, and Fe, then Brachythecium rutabulum/Sciuro-hypnum curtum, and Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus the least. Statistically significant higher Fe concentrations were in the Syntrichia ruralis, compared to the Sciuro-hypnum curtum and Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus. The Syntrichia ruralis also had significantly higher Cd content compared to the Brachythecium rutabulum/Sciuro-hypnum curtum. The results of the GLM analysis showed that the content of various heavy metals depends on the moss species and the degree of fine particles in the environment, and it didn't depend on whether the moss grows on the soil or a hard substrate such as concrete, stone or asphalt."

Amino-functionalized thioureas, such as 2-(dimethylamino)cyclohexyl-(3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)thiourea (Takemoto's catalyst), are widely used organocatalysts with virtually unknown environmental safety data. Ecotoxicity studies based on theVibrio fischeriluminescence inhibition test reveal significant toxicity of Takemoto's catalyst (EC50= 7.9 mg/L) and its NH2-substituted analog (EC50= 7.2&7.4 mg/L). The observed toxic effect was pronounced by the influence of the trifluoromethyl moiety. En route to the porphyrin-based chemosensing of Takemoto-type thioureas, their supramolecular binding to a series of zinc porphyrins was studied with UV-Vis and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, computational analysis and single crystal X-ray diffraction. The association constant values generally increased with the increasing electron-withdrawing properties of the porphyrins and electron-donating ability of the thioureas, a result of the predominant Zn√¢‚Äπ¬ØN cation&dipole (Lewis acid&base) interaction. The binding event induced a CD signal in the Soret band region of the porphyrin hosts: a crucial property for chirality sensing of Takemoto-type thioureas."

One schoolyard was studied in each included country: Iceland, Norway, Finland, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. The affordances, facilities, and equipment for PA in schoolyards were identified through orthophoto maps and standard registration forms. Children's preferences were collected through group interviews at each participating school. A common design of schoolyards across countries indicated mostly flat topography with sparse vegetation and green areas dominated by large traditional sport arenas such as a football field, areas suitable for ball games, and track and field activities. Green spaces and varied topography were more prominent in Nordic countries. Across nationalities, the responses from pupils regarding the schoolyard were similar: they liked it though they wished for more variety of activities to do during recess. National regulations/recommendations for schoolyard design differed across the countries, being more restricted to sport fields and sport-related activities in Latvia and Lithuania, while in Nordic countries, the recommendations focused more on versatile schoolyard design."

Employing the CORINE Land Cover dataset to analyze the dynamic changes in land use/land cover (LULC) in Estonia over 28 years revealed that urban land increased by 33.96% in Harju County and by 19.50% in Tartu County. Therefore, after three decades of LULC changes, the large number of shifts from agricultural and forest land to urban ones in an unplanned manner have become of great concern. To this end, understanding how LULC change contributes to urban expansion will provide helpful information for policy-making in LULC and help make better decisions for future transitions in urban expansion orientation and plan for more sustainable cities. Many different factors govern urban expansion; however, physical and proximity factors play a significant role in explaining the spatial complexity of this phenomenon in Estonia. In this research, it was claimed that urban expansion was affected by the 12 proximity driving forces. In this regard, we applied LR and MLP neural network models to investigate the prediction power of these models and find the influential factors driving urban expansion in two Estonian counties. Using LR determined that the independent variables √¢‚Ç¨≈ìdistance from main roads (X7)√¢‚Ç¨¬ù, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìdistance from the core of main cities of Tallinn and Tartu land (X2)√¢‚Ç¨¬ù, and √¢‚Ç¨≈ìdistance from water land (X11)√¢‚Ç¨¬ù had a higher negative correlation with urban expansion in both counties. Indeed, this investigation requires thinking towards constructing a balance between urban expansion and its driving forces in the long term in the way of sustainability. Using the MLP model determined that the √¢‚Ç¨≈ìdistance from existing residential areas (X10)√¢‚Ç¨¬ù in Harju County and the √¢‚Ç¨≈ìdistance from the core of Tartu (X2)√¢‚Ç¨¬ù in Tartu County were the most influential driving forces. The LR model showed the prediction power of these variables to be 37% for Harju County and 45% for Tartu County. In comparison, the MLP model predicted nearly 80% of variability by independent variables for Harju County and approximately 50% for Tartu County, expressing the greater power of independent variables. Therefore, applying these two models helped us better understand the causative nature of urban expansion in Harju County and Tartu County in Estonia, which requires more spatial planning regulation to ensure sustainability."

Therefore, as an indicator of the extent of dissolution, the mass of the solid residue after reaction and the carbon content in it were determined. In general, both the weight of the solid residue (Figure 1) and carbon content (Figure 2) correlate well with the extent of reaction, and in both cases, it became clear that for the most part, the reaction time required to obtain high conversions was over 3√Ç¬†h. The hypothesis regarding organic content accounting for the entire carbon held true only in the case when the reaction temperature was set to 120√Ç¬∞C (Table 2;Figures 3&5), as at lower temperatures, traces of calcite were observed, according to the XRD analysis (Table 2). The solid residue was weighed after separation by centrifugation, and drying was performed at 105√Ç¬∞C for at least 24√Ç¬†h. Time intervals for reactions were set to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 24√Ç¬†h for studying the extraction kinetics. For each time interval, a separate experiment was conducted. The obtained dry solids were subjected to elemental analysis to understand how organics in the solid behave under the reaction conditions, as a function of reaction time. To check the mineral composition of reaction residue, the XRD analysis was performed (Table 2), as discussed inMineral Composition of Oil Shale and Its Oxidation Residues."

The present study aimed to map the motivating and demotivating factors for mathematics teachers to continue working in this profession. The effective sample comprised 164 Estonian mathematics teachers who responded to items regarding self-efficacy and job satisfaction and open-ended questions about motivating and demotivating factors regarding their work. The results showed thatstudents,salary and vacation, andjob environmentare both motivating and demotivating for mathematics teachers. On the one hand, helping the students to succeed (and witnessing the progress), satisfying salaries and a good job climate motivate the teachers. And at the same time, students' low motivation, poor salary, and straining work conditions (e.g., very high workload) serve as demotivating factors. We showed that mathematics teachers' work experience is an essential factor to be considered when thinking about motivating and demotivating factors for teachers, as well as their self-efficacy and job satisfaction. The reasons, possible impact, and potential interventions on an educational policy level are discussed."

However, no comprehensive research is available to date on the differences in suitability for fermentation between fresh apple juice and that of reconstituted apple juice concentrate. This study aimed to apply freshly pressed juice and juice concentrate made from the same apple cultivar as a substrate for cider fermentation. Differences in yeast performance in terms of fermentation kinetics and consumption of nutrients have been assessed. Fermented ciders were compared according to volatile ester composition and off-flavor formation related to hydrogen sulfide. Based on the results, in the samples fermented with the concentrate, the yeasts consumed less fructose. The formation of long-chain fatty acid esters increased with the use of reconstituted juice concentrate while the differences in off-flavor formation could not be determined. Overall, the use of the concentrate can be considered efficient enough for the purpose of cider fermentation.

Minor changes were seen in FYB and MCB, which had lower pH values, and contained a larger amount of ingredients that include polyphenols. In addition, the choice of packaging material did not affect the TPC decrease in each puree.

Up to the present time, a standardized scale has not been developed to examine farmers' sustainability barriers to meteorological information use (BMIU). Furthermore, there is no doubt that identifying indicators and dimensions of sustainability barriers to meteorological information and weather forecasts' usage by farmers can play a major role in their adaptation and resilience to the risks of climate change. Therefore, the present study aimed to generate and validate a scale for BMIU by farmers through an eight-step approach. Accordingly, the statistical population included 9006 Iranian farmers, 368 of whom were selected as study samples. The principal component factor analysis (PCFA) and second-order confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were further practiced to develop the scale for meteorological information and weather forecasts' use. Factor analysis also led to the emergence of five latent factors including √¢‚Ç¨≈ìeducational&communicative barriers (ECBs)√¢‚Ç¨¬ù, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìnormative barriers (NBs)√¢‚Ç¨¬ù, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìinformational barriers (IBs)√¢‚Ç¨¬ù, √¢‚Ç¨≈ìinfrastructural&political barriers (IPBs)√¢‚Ç¨¬ù, and √¢‚Ç¨≈ìprofessional&economic barriers (PEBs)√¢‚Ç¨¬ù. The second-order CFA correspondingly confirmed these five factors and their 25 related indicators. Given the challenges facing academic scholars, decision makers, and authorities in the application and facilitation of meteorological information, the developed multidimensional scale in this study along with its implementation steps can be effective in examining the limitations of utilizing such information and measuring its impacts in different agricultural communities."

The existing non-residential building stock in the studied countries has been divided into varying amounts of groups and sub-groups. The energy requirements have been shifting from the increasing requirements for the U-values of the building envelope (before the 2000s) towards calculated energy demand for buildings as a whole (currently). The requirements for buildings in the near future will be carbon emission based. The energy efficiency of N-RBs in all of the studied case countries have been steadily improved during different decades of construction.

This type of plywood is designed to offer improved characteristics over standard plywood, including enhanced strength, stiffness, resistance to impact and moisture, and environmental degradation. By integrating reinforcing fibers, such as glass, carbon, or natural fibers (like flax, bamboo, or hemp) into or onto plywood, manufacturers can create a material that is better suited for applications where traditional plywood might fall short or when a decrease in product weight or savings in wood raw material are necessary. This report reviews the current progress in fiber-reinforced plywood in the context of plywood as a construction material to better understand the potential gains in plywood applications, mechanical parameters, and material savings. It is found that a simple and cost-effective procedure of fiber reinforcement allows for substantial improvements in plywood's mechanical properties, typically to the extent of 10&40%. It is suggested that the wider adoption of fiber-reinforced plywood, especially in load- and impact-bearing applications, would greatly contribute to enhanced durability and longevity of the material while also allowing for more sustainable use of raw wood material."

We contribute to that by conducting exploratory qualitative research into the phenomenon of perceived financial well-being and its components. It is based on three studies each of which used in-depth semi-structured interviews (N=√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞47). The first key finding is that youth perceive financial well-being to be comprised of three components: keeping the current lifestyle and making ends meet; achieving desired lifestyle; and achieving financial freedom. In contrast, older groups distinguish only two: keeping and achieving the lifestyle in the present and in the future. The second finding is that the definition of financial freedom differs across age groups. Young people aspire to become financially independent, while middle-aged individuals prioritize supporting their children, and older people are afraid of becoming a financial burden. Third, regardless of age, many do not plan, save or invest for securing their financial well-being. We conclude by proposing implications for increasing financial well-being in different age groups, and suggesting paths for further investigation."

We hypothesize that fish body geometry may substantially influence the velocity experienced by fish swimming. To test this hypothesis, we built nine full-scale physical prototypes of common freshwater fish species. The prototypes were placed in a large laboratory flume and upstream time-averaged velocity profiles were measured with increasing distance from the anterior-most location of each body. The measurements revealed that the body geometry can have a significant influence on the velocity profile, reducing the flow field at a distance of one body length upstream of the fish. Furthermore, it was found that the upstream velocity profiles from the nine fish species investigated in this study can be normalized to a single fit curve based on the freestream velocity and fish body length under subcritical flow conditions. These findings are significant, because they show that conventional point velocity measurements overlook the reducing effect of the fish body on the upstream flow field, creating a systematically biased representation of the velocity experienced by fish in subcritical flowing waters. This bias is illustrated by velocity field maps created with and without the presence of the physical models for three different fish species. Finally, we provide an example of how point velocity measurements can be recalculated to provide upstream velocity field maps closer to √¢‚Ç¨≈ìthe fish's perspective√¢‚Ç¨¬ù."

In this study, we investigate the multispecies risk of injury and mortality during downstream passage through a large Archimedes hydrodynamic screw for bream (Abramis brama), eel (Anguilla anguilla), and roach (Rutilus rutilus) in conjunction with passive sensors that record the pressure, acceleration, and rate of rotation. This work proposes several new metrics to assess downstream passage including the times and durations of impact events, the kinetic energies of translation and rotation, and the pressure gradient. The major findings of this work are three-fold: (1) Significant differences in injury and mortality were observed between the three investigated species with 37% mortality for bream, 19% for roach, and 3% for eel on average. (2) The operational scenario was found to be significant only for a limited number of species-specific injuries and mortality rates.

However, interfacing CE to a various flow of interest requires further study. In this paper, several ingenious approaches on interfacing flow from various chemical or bioprocesses to a capillary electrophoresis instrument are reviewed. Most of these interfaces can be described as computer-controlled autosamplers. Even though most of the described interfaces waste too many samples, many interesting and important applications of the devices are reported. However, the lack of commercially available devices prevents the wide application of CE for flow analysis.

Perception is challenging, wherein it suffers from dynamic objects and continuous environmental changes. The issue grows worse due to interrupting the quality of perception via adverse weather such as snow, rain, fog, night light, sand storms, strong daylight, etc. In this work, we have tried to improve camera-based perception accuracy, such as autonomous-driving-related object detection in adverse weather. We proposed the improvement of YOLOv8-based object detection in adverse weather through transfer learning using merged data from various harsh weather datasets. Two prosperous open-source datasets (ACDC and DAWN) and their merged dataset were used to detect primary objects on the road in harsh weather. A set of training weights was collected from training on the individual datasets, their merged versions, and several subsets of those datasets according to their characteristics. A comparison between the training weights also occurred by evaluating the detection performance on the datasets mentioned earlier and their subsets. The evaluation revealed that using custom datasets for training significantly improved the detection performance compared to the YOLOv8 base weights. Furthermore, using more images through the feature-related data merging technique steadily increased the object detection performance."

Some individuals can report, for example, that ethnic identity and integration have never played an important role in their lives and even feel that they represent old-fashioned notions from which modern societies should rather move on. For others, these concepts are much more relevant and are experienced in more challenging and complex ways. This article explores the influence that identity complexity: a cognitive disposition to perceive overlaps between different social identities, plays in this process. Forty parents of Estonian&foreign children (a traditionally cosmopolitan segment) were interviewed in Estonia and prompted to talk about topics such as their own ethnic identity(ies), their (and their family's) feelings of integration into the Estonian society, and the way in which they represent their children's ethnic identities, e.g., mostly Estonian/foreign, fifty&fifty, global citizen, etc. Thematic analysis combined with intersectionality suggests that there are associations between the identity complexity of interviewees and their attitudes towards these topics. Furthermore, results show that beyond the traditional dichotomy of high vs. low identity complexity, some interviewed parents have transitioned from higher to lower levels of identity complexity and vice versa at different times in their lives for different reasons. This study sheds light on identity complexity as a relevant predictor of acculturation and ethnic identity development outcomes among multicultural family members. It also contributes to the literature on cosmopolitan populations as a diverse group."

During the last decade, several global DEMs have been released based on satellite data. ASTER and SRTM are the most widely used DEMs, but the more recently released, AW3D30, TanDEM-X and MERIT, are being increasingly used. Many researchers have studied the quality of these DEM products in recent years. However, there has been no comprehensive and systematic evaluation of their quality over areas with variable topography and land cover conditions. To provide this comparison, we examined the accuracy of six freely available global DEMs (ASTER, AW3D30, MERIT, TanDEM-X, SRTM, and NASADEM) in four geographic regions with different topographic and land use conditions. We used local high-precision elevation models (Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), Pleiades-1A) as reference models and all global models were resampled to reference model resolution (1m). In total, 608 million 1x1 m pixels were analyzed. To estimate the accuracy, we generated error rasters by subtracting each reference model from the corresponding global DEM and calculated descriptive statistics for this difference (e.g., median, mean, root-mean-square error (RMSE)). We also assessed the vertical accuracy as a function of the slope, slope aspect, and land cover. We found that slope had the strongest effect on DEM accuracy, with no relationship for slope aspect. The AW3D30 was the most robust and had the most stable performance in most of the tests and is therefore the best choice for an analysis of multiple geographic regions. SRTM and NASADEM also performed well where available, whereas NASADEM, as a successor of SRTM, showed only slight improvement in comparison to SRTM. MERIT and TanDEM-X also performed well despite their lower spatial resolution."

By employing biomimetic surface modifications, for example, roughness tailoring, multifunctionality of the system can be generated to efficiently reduce friction and wear, enhance load-bearing capacity, improve self-adaptiveness in different environments, improve chemical interactions, facilitate biological interactions, etc. However, the full potential of bioinspired texturing remains untapped due to the limited mechanistic understanding of functional aspects in tribological/biotribological settings. The current review extends to surface engineering and provides a comprehensive and critical assessment of bioinspired texturing that exhibits sustainable synergy between tribology and biology. The successful evolving examples from nature for surface/tribological solutions that can efficiently solve complex tribological problems in both dry and lubricated contact situations are comprehensively discussed. The review encompasses four major wear conditions: sliding, solid-particle erosion, machining or cutting, and impact (energy absorbing). Furthermore, it explores how topographies and their design parameters can provide tailored responses (multifunctionality) under specified tribological conditions. Additionally, an interdisciplinary perspective on the future potential of bioinspired materials and structures with enhanced wear resistance is presented."

Investigating the factors affecting urban expansion and modeling it are critical steps to detect future expansion trends and plan for a more sustainable environment. Different models have been used to investigate, predict, and simulate urban expansion in recent years. In this paper, we coupled the cellular automata, agent-based, and Markov models (CA&Agent model) in a novel manner to address the complexity of the dynamic simulation, generate heterogeneity in space, define more complicated rules, and employ the suitability analysis. In the CA&Agent model, cells are dynamic agents, and the model's outcome emerges from cellular agents' interactions over time using the rules of behavior and their decisions concerning the adjacent neighboring cells and probabilities of spatial changes. We performed the CA&Agent model run two times for 2018 and 2030. The first simulated results were used to validate the performance of the model. Kappa showed 0.86, indicating a relatively high model fit, so we conducted the second 12-year run up to the year 2030. The results illustrated that using these model parameters, the overall built-up areas will reach 175.24 sq. km with an increase of 30.25% in total from 1990 to 2030. Thus, implementing the CA&Agent model in the study area illustrated the temporal changes of land conversion and represented the present spatial planning results requiring regulation of urban expansion encroachment on agricultural and forest lands."

The present study investigates the feasibility of the LIBS method to analyse the composition and fuel retention in three samples from WEST divertor erosion marker tiles after the experimental campaign C3. The investigated samples originated from tile regions outside of strong erosion and deposition regions, where the variation of thin deposit layers is relatively small and facilitates cross-comparison between different analysis methods. The depth profiles of main constituents W, Mo and C were consistent with depth profiles determined by other composition analysis methods, such as glow-discharge optical emission spectroscopy (GDOES) and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). The average LIBS depth resolution determined from depth profiles was 100 nm/shot. The averaging of the spectra collected from multiple spots of a same sample allowed us to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, investigate the presence of fuel D and trace impurities such as O and B. In the investigated tile regions with negligible erosion and deposition, these impurities were clearly detectable during the first laser shot, while the signal decreased to noise level after a few subsequent laser shots at the same spot. LIBS investigation of samples originating from the deposition regions of tiles may further clarify LIBS' ability to investigate trace impurities."

Its severity is increasing due to the climate change caused by weather fluctuations. Intensive research on FHB control methods has been initiated more than a decade ago. Since then, the environment has been rapidly changing at regional to global scales due to increasing anthropogenic emissions enhanced fertilizer application and substantial changes in land use. It is known that environmental factors affect both the pathogen virulence as well as plant resistance mechanisms. Changes in CO2concentration, temperature, and water availability can have positive, neutral, or negative effects on pathogen spread depending on the environmental optima of the pathosystem. Hence, there is a need for studies of plant&pathogen interactions in current and future environmental context. Long-term monitoring data are needed in order to understand the complex nature of plants and its microbiome interactions. We suggest an holobiotic approach, integrating plant phyllosphere microbiome research on the ecological background. This will enable the development of efficient strategies based on ecological know-how to fightFusariumpathogens and maintain sustainable agricultural systems."

Two types of √é¬≤-D-galactans are widely distributed in plant cell walls. 4-Linked √é¬≤-D-galactan chains are important substituents of the backbone of rhamnogalacturonan I (RGI), one of the major polysaccharides in pectins (Caffal and Mohnen, 2009). They are known as Type I galactans, and they may have non reducing terminal arabinose units or short 5-linked arabinofuranose chains linked to C-3 of some of the galactose units, plus minor amounts of other monosaccharides. Type II galactans are a diverse group of short 3- and 6-linked √é¬≤-D-galactan chains connected to each other by 3,6-linked residues, some of them also contain short arabino-oligosaccharide chains. They are major constituents of arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs), proteoglycans molecules located in Golgi-derived vesicles, the plasma membrane, and the cell wall (Ma et√Ç¬†al., 2018). In some cases, they are found in pectins as part of the complex RGI structure (Caffal and Mohnen, 2009). Besides, galactans are the major polysaccharides in extracellular matrixes from different algae, marine invertebrates, and other organisms; these galactans have an acidic character due to the presence of sulfate groups esterifying some of the hydroxyl groups of their monosaccharide components (Pomin, 2009). In particular, most of the red seaweeds biosynthesize sulfated galactans with a backbone that has no equivalent in terrestrial plants, constituted by alternating 3-linked √é¬≤-D-galactopyranosyl units (A-unit) and 4-linked √é¬±-galactopyranosyl residues (B-unit). In the industrially significant seaweeds as source of hydrocolloids, B-units belong either to the D-series and they produce carrageenans (as in Gigartinales), or to the L-series, and they are sources of agarose and/or structurally related polymers (i.e., Gelidiales, Gracilariales). In both cases, the latter units appear as cyclized 3,6-anhydro-√é¬±-galactose in a certain amount (Figure 1). Although the chemistry of sulfated galactans from these red seaweeds is fairly well studied, their biosynthesis is still under investigation (Usov, 2011)."

Gamma spectroscopy uses the energy spectra of emitted gamma rays to examine the type and quantity of isotopes that exist in samples. Like any other analytical technique, traditional gamma spectroscopy encounters challenges that in some cases make the analysis uncertain. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have been proposed as an approach for enhancing the precision and robustness of gamma spectroscopy. The current study introduces the basics behind ML and illustrates how they are applied in gamma spectroscopy using case studies. Major findings discussed herein demonstrate the developmental capability that ML has in improving gamma spectroscopy. Radioisotope identification, optimizing detector performance, and simplifying environmental monitoring processes have been the main areas in which ML algorithms have been deployed for improvement. These include the ability to predict and provide real-time spectrometry, among others, even though these opportunities come with their shortfalls such as the necessity for huge training datasets. This review explains that integrating ML into gamma spectroscopy marks a major change from current analytic techniques, with possible further developments in radiation detection and environmental science. It serves as very useful material for those studying or practicing AI and gamma spectroscopy and want to know more about it or need guidance on what is happening so far regarding AI integrated into gamma spectroscopy analysis."

In addition, it has been also been experimentally illustrated to elicit anti-cancer properties. Several in vitro and in vivo studies have illustrated the potential therapeutic efficiency of garcinol in management of different malignancies. It mainly acts as an inhibitor of cellular processes via regulation of transcription factors NF-√é¬∫B and JAK/STAT3 in tumor cells and have been demonstrated to effectively inhibit growth of malignant cell population. Numerous studies have highlighted the anti-neoplastic potential of garcinol in different oncological transformations including colon cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, head and neck cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, etc. However, use of garcinol is still in its pre-clinical stage and this is mainly attributed to the limitations of conclusive evaluation of pharmacological parameters. This necessitates evaluation of garcinol pharmacokinetics to precisely identify an appropriate dose and route of administration, tolerability, and potency under physiological conditions along with characterization of a therapeutic index. Hence, the research is presently ongoing in the dimension of exploring the precise metabolic mechanism of garcinol. Despite various lacunae, garcinol has presented with promising anti-cancer effects. Hence, this review is motivated by the constantly emerging and promising positive anti-cancerous effects of garcinol. This review is the first effort to summarize the mechanism of action of garcinol in modulation of anti-cancer effect via regulation of different cellular processes."

These acetogens utilize the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway to fix one-carbon molecules, specifically CO and CO2, converting them into acetyl-CoA (Fackler et al., 2021). From this pivotal central metabolite, a variety of valuable chemicals can be synthesized (Liew et al., 2016). Understanding and optimizing CO conversion is important as CO is a major component of syngas and industrial flue gas. Moreover, the standard redox potential of the CO2/CO half-cell (√¢ÀÜ‚Äô520√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞mV) is more negative than that of the 2H+/H2half-cell (√¢ÀÜ‚Äô420√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞mV). This means that CO conversion has more potential to produce reduced metabolites than the conversion of CO2as a sole carbon source with the help of H2oxidation (Chu et al., 2020). Some of the possible reactions that lead to ethanol formation from CO2and CO are listed inEqs. 1&4."

To achieve that goal, we used highly potential delivery vectors, cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), as oligonucleotide carriers for the development of a therapeutic approach for endometriosis and cancer. Despite marked differences, both of these conditions still exhibit similarities, like excessive, uncoordinated, and autonomous cellular proliferation and invasion, accompanied by overlapping gene expression patterns. Thus, in the current study, we investigated the therapeutic effects of CPP and siRNA nanoparticles using in vitro models of benign endometriosis and malignant glioblastoma. We demonstrated that CPPs PepFect6 and NickFect70 are highly effective in transfecting cell lines, primary cell cultures, and three-dimensional spheroids. CPP nanoparticles are capable of inducing siRNA-specific knockdown of therapeutic genes, ribonucleotide reductase subunit M2 (RRM2), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which results in the reduction of in vitro cellular proliferation, invasion, and migration. In addition, we proved that it is possible to achieve synergistic suppression of endometriosis cellular proliferation and invasion by combining gene therapy and hormonal treatment approaches by co-administering CPP/siRNA nanoparticles together with the endometriosis-drug danazol. We suggest a novel target, RRM2, for endometriosis therapy and as a proof-of-concept, we propose a CPP-mediated gene therapy approach for endometriosis and cancer."

This has generated a new wave of studies aiming to analyse the genetic component of traits in historic and prehistoric times using ancient DNA, and to determine whether any such traits were subject to natural selection. In humans, however, issues about the portability and robustness of complex trait inference across different populations are particularly concerning when predictions are extended to individuals that died thousands of years ago, and for which little, if any, phenotypic validation is possible. In this review, we discuss the advantages of incorporating ancient genomes into studies of trait-associated variants, the need for models that can better accommodate ancient genomes into quantitative genetic frameworks, and the existing limits to inferences about complex trait evolution, particularly with respect to past populations."

The high light sensitivity ofKLandKBprovides a regulatory mechanism to maintain a balance between transpirational demand and hydraulic supply. The plasticity of these traits increases the ability of plants to cope with a rapidly changing environment and to adapt to global climate change."

This paper discusses the problem of poverty especially in relation to food waste. The prevention of food waste can also contribute to global poverty reduction, and the reduction of food waste is a tool for sustainable growth and competitiveness. At present, the number of people at risk of poverty and the amount of food waste are increasing at unsustainable rates. An integrated and efficient tool for the management of food, energy, and water (FEW) resources to improve FEW security via an interdisciplinary approach could help address several of the most significant global challenges, such as climate change, and economic, environmental, and social security. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between the existence of poverty and the treatment of food for sustainable growth. The analysis focused on the EU countries and the main data source was the Eurostat database. Households generally create the largest proportion of food waste. Pareto analysis shows that in households, food and non-alcoholic beverages are among the first group of expenses, and in the EU countries they represent approximately 12% of the total expenses. Food and non-alcoholic beverages are a stable, unavoidable, and non-negligible element of total expenses. Paradoxically, enormous amounts of food are wasted. A relatively weak inversely proportional relationship between the amount of food waste per capita and the proportion of the population at risk of poverty among the total population of EU countries was identified through correlational analysis. A very weak relationship between the share of the population at risk of poverty in the total population and the amount of food waste per capita, excluding the population at risk of poverty, was also found."

These leaves can be a valuable source of antioxidants to be used in pharmaceuticals or other health-related products. In this study, the leaves of grapevine cultivars were analysed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatograph-diode array detector () for the total polyphenols (TPC) and resveratrol affected by cultivar, leaf-removal time and viticultural practice. The effect of cultivar varied yearly, European grapevine cv. √¢‚Ç¨ÀúRegent' had increased TPC and resveratrol in comparison to √¢‚Ç¨ÀúBoskoop's Glory', √¢‚Ç¨ÀúRondo' and √¢‚Ç¨ÀúSolaris' in 2017, but √¢‚Ç¨ÀúSolaris' in 2018. TPC (1213&1841 mg 100 g√¢ÀÜ‚Äô1) and resveratrol (1.061 mg 100 g√¢ÀÜ‚Äô1) were higher in leaves of interspecific hybrid cvs. √¢‚Ç¨ÀúZilga' and √¢‚Ç¨ÀúHasansky Sladky' during full fruit ripeness. Cv. √¢‚Ç¨ÀúRondo' grown under the polytunnel had decreased TPC in leaves. In conclusion, cultivar selection, viticultural practice and leaf-removal time contribute significantly to the accumulation of total polyphenols and resveratrol. Results of this study will contribute to better utilization of biomass produced in the vineyards, help to decrease the negative environmental impacts, and provide an overview on various factors affecting the biochemical constituents, especially in leaves."

Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is a central hormone in regulating resource allocation, with higher IGF-1 levels resulting in more growth. IGF-1 levels generally increase in conjunction with nutritional state, but whether IGF-1 levels are adjusted in response to current nutrient availability or to the nutrient availability integrated over a longer term is not well known. We tested for such effects by supplementary feeding the jackdaw (Corvus monedula) nestlings in experimentally reduced or enlarged broods with either water (control) or a food solution; these manipulations have long- and short-term effects on the nutritional state, respectively. Baseline plasma IGF-1 levels were higher in reduced broods. Food supplementation induced an increase in plasma IGF-1 levels measured one hour later, and this effect was significantly more substantial in nestlings in reduced broods. Changes in plasma IGF-1 levels increased with increased retention of the supplementary food, which was higher in reduced broods, explaining the stronger IGF-1 response. Thus, IGF-1 levels respond to short-term variations in the nutritional state, but this effect is amplified by longer-term variations in the nutritional state. We discuss our findings using a graphical model that integrates the results of the two treatments."

Most people do this all around the world but throwing away food can actually harm the environment. One way to reduce this harm is by turning the food scraps into animal feed. This not only helps the environment but also makes livestock production cheaper. Different technologies have been developed to make a safe and healthy animal feed from food waste. This helps us to get rid of waste by giving animals a new source of protein and recycling the discarded food waste. This article talks about how to turn food waste into animal food and its advantages. However, it is important to make sure the feed is of high quality and safe for the animals. It is also important to do research and development to make even better food-waste-based animal feed by reducing production costs and waste disposal, thereby making things better for both the animals and the environment. Overall, using food waste as animal food is a good waste management idea that provides food security and preserves the environment. So, next time when you have some leftover food, remember that it could be turned into something useful instead of being thrown away."

In an effort to see how the overall radiosensitivity might be affected when the two radiosensitizers are combined in the same molecule, we studied the gas-phase photodissociation of two brominated nitroimidazoles and a bromine-free reference sample. Synchrotron radiation was employed to initiate the photodynamics and energy-resolved multiparticle coincidence spectroscopy was used to study the ensuing dissociation. We observed the brominated samples releasing high amounts of potentially radiosensitizing fragments upon dissociation. Since bromination also increases the likelihood of the drug molecule being ionised per a given X-ray dose, we conclude that heavy-element substitution of nitroimidazoles appears to be a viable path towards new, potent radiosensitizer drugs."

This review will provide a detailed overview on the efficiency and applicability of various adsorbents, i.e., carbon nanotubes, graphene, silica, zero-valent iron, and magnetic nanoparticles for scavenging metallic ions. These nanoparticles exhibit potential to be used in extracting a variety of toxic metals. Recently, nanomaterial-assisted bioelectrochemical removal of heavy metals has also emerged. To that end, various nanoparticle-based electrodes are being developed, offering more efficient, cost-effective, ecofriendly, and sustainable options.

The implantable and biodegradable TENG devices require excellent triboelectric properties, as well as the ability to mimic the mechanical properties of the surrounding tissues and exhibiting low cytotoxicity and eventual degradation and removal by bio-absorption. Two-step synthesis of PGS was carried out by using polycondensation between glycerol and sebacic acid in 1:1 molar ratio, followed by film preparation by spray-coating of the prepolymer solution. Crosslinking conditions were elaborated to yield good triboelectric performance together with low cytotoxicity. Triboelectric surface charge density of up to 0.188 nC cm√¢ÀÜ‚Äô2was obtained, exceeding the values of common triboelectric materials such as PDMS and PTFE by 2.89 and 3.76 times, respectively, when tested under identical contact-separation parameters. The mechanical properties of PGS can be tuned by varying the crosslinking degree to mimic soft tissues. In this context, in vitro studies on human skin fibroblasts revealed cell viability up to 78%. Furthermore, the cell viability is found to be strongly related to the crosslinking time of the PGS. The results show significantly lower cytotoxicity as compared to, for example, poly(sorbitol sebacate) and poly(hexanediol-co-citric acid). The flexibility and the confirmed biocompatibility beside the unique mechanical and physio-chemical collective properties of the of the polymer demonstrates the potential use of PGS for the next generation of implantable TENG devices.Graphical abstract"

This study describes HL usage among Estonian-Swedish bilingual teenagers. Data were collected from 21 first- and second-generation Estonian heritage speakers (aged 12&17). Non-standard usage occurred in our corpus at low rates but was found across most speakers in certain areas of morphosyntax. We describe which factors drive such non-standard usage based on the example of two structures with more frequent non-standard occurrence: (1) object marking and (2) experiencer constructions with the verbmeeldima√¢‚Ç¨Àúto like/please'. Around 6% of objects were marked in divergent ways. Speakers employed two strategies for marking non-standard objects: case omission (i.e., using nominative and/or unmarked forms) and substitution (i.e., using non-target-like marking). Non-standard forms occurred in 11% of experiencer constructions. Speakers diverged more with marking the nominative Stimulus than the dative-like Experiencer, although both occurred in standard and non-standard forms. The reported usage patterns can be explained through the combined effect of cross-linguistic influence, simplification, and input frequency. We also tested the relation between non-standard usage and the speaker's sociolinguistic background, with mixed results. Considering the limited size and scope of the corpus, overall, the reported divergent usage patterns evidence the role of linguistic input and cross-linguistic effects."

Nonlinear, saturating, and hysteretic magnetization was recorded in the films. Magnetization was expectedly dominated by increasing the content of Fe2O3. However, coercive force could also be enhanced by the choice of appropriate ratios of HfO2and Fe2O3in nanolaminated structures. Saturation magnetization was observed in the measurement temperature range of 5&350 K, decreasing towards higher temperatures and increasing with the films' thicknesses and crystal growth. Coercive force tended to increase with a decrease in the thickness of crystallized layers. The films containing insulating HfO2layers grown alternately with magnetic Fe2O3exhibited abilities to both switch resistively and magnetize at room temperature. Resistive switching was unipolar in all the oxides mounted between Ti and TiN electrodes."

Of specific interest are sustainable, chemically activated, microporous carbon adsorbents, especially from renewable and organic precursor materials. In this article, six peat-derived microporous carbon materials were synthesized by chemical activation with ZnCl2. N2and CO2gas adsorption data were measured and simultaneously fitted with the 2D-NLDFT-HS model. Thus, based on the obtained results, the use of a low ratio of ZnCl2for chemical activation of peat-derived carbon yields highly ultramicroporous carbons which are able to adsorb up to 83% of the maximal adsorbed amount of adsorbed H2already at 1 bar at 77 K. This is accompanied by the high ratio of micropores, 99%, even at high specific surface area of 1260 m2g√¢ÀÜ‚Äô1, exhibited by the peat-derived carbon activated at 973 K using a 1:2 ZnCl2to peat mass ratio. These results show the potential of using low concentrations of ZnCl2as an activating agent to synthesize highly ultramicroporous carbon materials with suitable pore characteristics for the efficient low-pressure adsorption of H2."

Counterfeiting luxury products has resulted in economic losses for both the producers and consumers. The market for counterfeit luxury products has continued to grow due to the difficulty in authenticating genuine luxury products. The traditional system of verification largely depends on the expert use of specialized equipment for visually inspecting physical luxury products and their associated certificates. This conventional process of authenticating luxury products is expensive, slow, and not easily accessible to consumers. Hence, there is a need for a digital verification approach for luxury products. Blockchain provides the potential for providing traceable and immutable information about a given luxury product. The focus of this paper is to develop a blockchain decentralized application (DApp) for authenticating luxury products in the class of luxury accessories such as jewelry across their respective lifecycles. To achieve this, qualitative analytics is applied to identify useful features for the digital authentication of luxury products. Blockchain requirement engineering modelling is then applied to explore the use of blockchain technologies to realize the features that guarantee transparency in the ownership and use of luxury products. Furthermore, this paper explores the existing blockchain technologies for realizing and implementing the developed requirements of the authentication DApp for luxury products. The selected blockchain technology stack is applied in prototyping authentication systems for luxury products. The implemented platform is simulated to demonstrate the operations carried out in authenticating luxury products."

However, functional studies and biotechnological applications of photosystems necessitate the use of proteins isolated in aqueous solution, so that the relevance of high-resolution structures has to be independently verified. In this regard, small-angle neutron and X-ray scattering (SANS and SAXS, respectively) can serve as the missing link because of their capability to provide structural information for proteins in aqueous solution at physiological temperatures. In the present review, we discuss the principles and prototypical applications of SANS and SAXS using the photosynthetic pigment&protein complexes phycocyanin (PC) and Photosystem I (PSI) as model systems for a water-soluble and for a membrane protein, respectively. For example, the solution structure of PSI was studied using SAXS and SANS with contrast matching. A Guinier analysis reveals that PSI in solution is virtually free of aggregation and characterized by a radius of gyration of about 75 √É‚Ä¶. The latter value is about 10% larger than expected from the crystal structure. This is corroborated by an ab initio structure reconstitution, which also shows a slight expansion of Photosystem I in buffer solution at room temperature. In part, this may be due to conformational states accessible by thermally activated protein dynamics in solution at physiological temperatures. The size of the detergent belt is derived by comparison with SANS measurements without detergent match, revealing a monolayer of detergent molecules under proper solubilization conditions."

After the clearcutting of hybrid aspen plantation, the next generation arises from root and stump sprouts. The economic feasibility of different management strategies of hybrid aspen coppice stands has not yet been comprehensively evaluated in Northern Europe. We compared the land expectation values (LEVs) of hybrid aspen coppice stands managed according to four scenarios: three early thinning methods (corridor, cross-corridor and single-tree) followed by conventional management and intensive bioenergy production (repeated harvests in 5-year rotations) over a 25-year period in hemiboreal Estonia. We considered the historic price volatility of aspen wood assortments under various discount rates (1&20%). We found that the 25-year rotation with different early thinning methods was more profitable than short bioenergy cycles in the case of low discount rates (<5%). The LEV of short coppice cycles for only bioenergy production became more profitable in comparison with those by thinning methods, when higher discount rates (>10%) were applied. Hybrid aspen coppice stands can be managed profitably, but more risks are taken when the management strategy focuses only on bioenergy production."

The cultural revival of the Khanty bear ceremony in Western Siberia could be a perfect example. It is on one hand a key representation of local Indigenous ontology and on the other has become a token in cultural heritage preservation by state actors and a cultural commodity for local tourism and media outlets. Indigenous activists struggle against the loss of authenticity with ideas of purism and scholars identifying the amalgamation of Indigenous ritual elements with Christian ideas and inventions of tradition on the other hand. I argue that the perception of original purity of elements that develop into hybrid forms in the colonial and postcolonial context is somewhat misleading. Instead, I propose that we look at hybridity and purity as intertwined dialectical aspects of cultural politics with a multiplicity of voices and perspectives and negotiated relations at several levels."

Imagined speech can be used to allow physically impaired patients to communicate and to use smart devices by imagining desired commands and then detecting and executing those commands in a smart device. The goal of this research is to verify previous classification attempts made and then design a new, more efficient neural network that is noticeably less complex (fewer number of layers) that still achieves a comparable classification accuracy. The classifiers are designed to distinguish between EEG signal patterns corresponding to imagined speech of different vowels and words. This research uses a dataset that consists of 15 subjects imagining saying the five main vowels (a, e, i, o, u) and six different words. Two previous studies on imagined speech classifications are verified as those studies used the same dataset used here. The replicated results are compared. The main goal of this study is to take the proposed convolutional neural network (CNN) model from one of the replicated studies and make it much more simpler and less complex, while attempting to retain a similar accuracy. The pre-processing of data is described and a new CNN classifier with three different transfer learning methods is described and used to classify EEG signals. Classification accuracy is used as the performance metric. The new proposed CNN, which uses half as many layers and less complex pre-processing methods, achieved a considerably lower accuracy, but still managed to outperform the initial model proposed by the authors of the dataset by a considerable margin. It is recommended that further studies investigating classifying imagined speech should use more data and more powerful machine learning techniques. Transfer learning proved beneficial and should be used to improve the effectiveness of neural networks."

However, there is little agreement in the philosophical literature as to what it amounts to and how to even investigate it. In this paper, we propose a natural kind methodology to study vividness and suggest treating it as a homeostatic property cluster with an underlying nature that explains the correlation of properties in that cluster. This approach relies on the empirical research on the vividness of mental imagery and contrasts with those accounts that treat vividness as an explanatory primitive and with those that attempt to provide a definition. We apply the natural kind methodology to make several substantive (but also provisional) claims about the vividness of mental imagery. First, we will argue that it forms a homeostatic property cluster, in that it is reliably correlated with, but not defined by, some properties, such as the level of detail, clarity, perception-likeness and intensity. In arguing for this claim, we also show how the cluster can be modified in the light of empirical research by complementing it with a correlation between vividness and familiarity. Second, we will argue that these correlations can be explained by an underlying property at the architectural level; i.e., the availability of stored sensory information for the elaboration of a mental image."

Thus, more detailed insight regarding the tumor molecular markers that may affect the responsiveness of patients to therapy is required. Here, we set out to explore the proteome of two lung adenocarcinoma cell lines (HCC-44 and A549) treated with cisplatin, pemetrexed, durvalumab, and the corresponding mixtures to establish the differences in post-treatment protein expression that can serve as markers of chemosensitivity or resistance. The mass spectrometry study showed that the addition of durvalumab to the treatment mixture resulted in cell line- and chemotherapeutic agent-dependent responses and confirmed the previously reported involvement of DNA repair machinery in the potentiation of the chemotherapy effect. Further validation using immunofluorescence also indicated that the potentiating effect of durvalumab in the case of cisplatin treatment was dependent on the tumor suppressor RB-1 in the PD-L1 weakly positive cells. In addition, we identified aldehyde dehydrogenase ALDH1A3 as the general putative resistance marker. Further studies in patient biopsy samples will be required to confirm the clinical significance of these findings."

As learners construct their understanding about an ET and develop related skills by actually passing through the ET Innovation Process (IP) stages (Awareness, Acceptance and Adoption), it could be useful to provide them with training that imitates certain IP stages. Using Artificial Intelligence Enhanced Robotics (AIER) as the example ET, we designed a two-day workshop to lead learners (n =16) through the AIER IP Awareness stage, and a six-week training course with eight contact days to simulate the AIER IP Acceptance stage to learners (n =10). Using online surveys and quantitative content analysis methods we confirmed that the workshop format increased the AIER-related self-confidence and general knowledge in 78% of participants, while the training course helped more than half of the participants to construct usable knowledge about a specific AIER and to see its possibilities in their specific work-place contexts. This paper is the pilot of using the Technology-Enhanced Learning Innovation Process (TELIP) model, first tested on a STEAM innovation, outside the educational context, for developing appropriate training approaches for specific ET IP stages."

The process is expected to be finalised in 2023, making it the first area where Soviet architecture would be under protection in Estonia. By approaching the town theoretically and methodologically as a heritagescape where components of tangible landscape are used to create a distinct place of the past, looking at how the town's official development policy relates to the existing representations of the past in the town's memory institutions, and interviewing local stakeholders, this article provides a broader and more nuanced understanding of Sillam‰e and its tourism potential. Sillam‰e as heritagescape offers tourists the chance to experience a curated version of the Soviet era and contemplate on the legacy of nuclear industry, while remaining in the safety of a resort town in the periphery of the European Union."

Nevertheless, the impact of the number of slices and slice size on the radio access network (RAN) slice performance has not yet been studied. This research is needed to understand the effects of creating subslices on slice resources to serve slice users and how the performance of RAN slices is affected by the number and size of these subslices. A slice is divided into numbers of subslices of different sizes, and the slice performance is evaluated based on the slice bandwidth utilization and slice goodput. A proposed subslicing algorithm is compared with k-means UE clustering and equal UE grouping. The MATLAB simulation results show that subslicing can improve slice performance. If the slice contains all UEs with a good block error ratio (BLER), then a slice performance improvement of up to 37% can be achieved, and it comes more from the decrease in bandwidth utilization than the increase in goodput. If a slice contains UEs with a poor BLER, then the slice performance can be improved by up to 84%, and it comes only from the goodput increase. The most important criterion in subslicing is the minimum subslice size in terms of resource blocks (RB), which is 73 for a slice that contains all good-BLER UEs. If a slice contains UEs with poor BLER, then the subslice can be smaller."

Using relevant learning skills assures better learning outcomes and abilities for the whole life course. Due to a packed curriculum or teachers having insufficient skills, student learning skills are often neglected. The aim of this study is to find out whether it is possible to support the development of declarative knowledge in learning skills in teachers through procedural knowledge acquired via practical teaching activities. A quasi-experimental study using semi-structured pre- and post-intervention interviews and six-month intervention activities was conducted with 14 teachers. The procedural knowledge of the teachers was assessed based on their practical experience with the intervention activities. Their declarative knowledge was assessed based on pre- and post-intervention interview reflections. The findings revealed that procedural knowledge, being predominantly teacher centred, mostly appears through experience and reflections on the teaching practice that guides them. It also appeared that the intervention focusing on advancing procedural knowledge among teachers advanced their declarative knowledge in terms of metacognition, revealing new aspects of motivation and sense-giving for their learning. As follow-up research, we plan to continue studying conditional knowledge in teachers in order to identify situations where this is applied."

Correlations between protein dynamics and function are typically anticipated when both molecular mobility and function are concurrently affected under specific temperatures or hydration conditions. In contrast, excitation energy transfer within the major photosynthetic light-harvesting complex II (LHC II) presents an atypical case, as it remains fully operational even at cryogenic temperatures, primarily depending on the interactions between electronic states and involving harmonic protein vibrations only. This review summarizes recent work on vibrational and conformational protein dynamics of LHC II and directly relates these findings to its light-harvesting function. In addition, we give a comprehensive introduction into the use of neutron spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the protein dynamics of photosynthetic protein complexes in solution, which is information complementary to that obtained by protein crystallography."

The extra-mathematical knowledge does not have to be mathematics-specific knowledge, but is rather a type of knowledge that benefits students by enabling them to use mathematics in a real-life situation (seeNiss, 1994). In the PISA mathematics assessment, students are not only expected to demonstrate mathematical knowledge, but also tackle real-world problems (OECD, 2023a). Beginning at level 2, students should be able to use mathematics in simple real-life situations, while students from level 4 onwards should be able to demonstrate the ability to integrate equations and formulas directly into aspects of real life (OECD, 2023b). In Estonia, 85% of students achieved at least level 2 and 34% achieved level 4 or above on the PISA 2022 test (OECD, 2023a;Tire et al., 2023). In addition to students' extra-mathematical knowledge, we measure understanding of complex sentences because a rather complicated representational process lies behind mathematical components, which allows the solver to interpret the text of the problem (Kintsch and Greeno, 1985). We aim to carry out preliminary research to investigate whether student math-specific skill profiles will differ regarding the extra-mathematical knowledge and understanding of complex sentences."

However, smallholder farmers, in particular, have experienced mixed impacts in inclusion and exclusion from modern supply chains (MSC). Therefore, by taking Pakistan's mandarin industry as a case, this study aims to analyze the farmers' efficiency and inclusiveness in modern supply chains and compare them across the farm size categories, i.e., small, medium, and large. For that purpose, cross-sectional data from 300 farmers were collected to test the posit objectives. The empirical investigation was made using the endogenous treatment effect model and the propensity score matching approach. Findings show that large farmers prefer to participate in MSC, driven by contractors, processors or exporters. Conversely, the smallholders are more inclined to participate in the traditional supply chains (TSCs), driven by village vendors, local retailers/consumers, middlemen, and traditional fruit and vegetable markets. The results also revealed a positive connection between efficiency and farmers' inclusion in the MSC. Orchard size, education, off-farm income, and extension services positively impact profitability. In terms of an increase in farmers' profitability, the efficiency improvement can benefit the resource-poor smallholders who make up 74% of the total farmers in the sample. Therefore, these results are noteworthy for devising policy actions to facilitate smallholder inclusion in the modern agri-food supply chains to alleviate rural poverty and ensure farmers' wellbeing."

Birch has been extensively used by the veneer-based industry, but species like black alder, gray alder and aspen have not been commonly used by the veneer-based products industry due to the lower quality of this resource. The aim of this research is to determine the effect of different lay-up schemes and usages of gray alder, black alder and aspen on the mechanical properties of plywood, by replacing birch veneer in the plywood core with alternative wood species. The main veneer and plywood characteristics will be evaluated according to the current standards, e.g., veneer strength perpendicular to grain, plywood bonding and bending strength, and modulus of elasticity. All processing parameters will be kept similar to those used generally by birch plywood manufacturers. The results showed that birch and black alder plywood panels had generally the highest bending strength properties, followed by grey alder and aspen. It was also found that, for proper gluing, birch veneers had the lowest glue consumption, 152 g/m2, and aspen had the highest glue consumption, 179 g/m2. It was found that when lower density wood was used in the plywood, the product density increased. Low density wood veneers had higher glue consumption, and also higher compaction in thickness than birch veneers under the same pressure. Overall, it was shown that the wood species used in this study have slightly lower strength properties, but with proper lay-up schemes, these wood species could be successfully used by the veneer-based products industry."

In total, 22 Diptera species or species groups were found in Estonian pig farms. There were altogether 186,701 individual arthropods collected, from which 96.6% (180,444) belonged to the order of true flies (Insecta: Diptera). The remaining 3.4% were from other insect orders, arachnids, or just damaged and unidentifiable specimens. The activity density and diversity of dipterans differed significantly between 12 sampled farms but not throughout the sampling period. The present study is amongst the few to provide a large-scale overview of pig-farm-associated Diptera in the temperate climate zone."

The current study aims to minimize the power consumed by robots in pick-and-place applications with long-term placing and short-term picking operations. The main contribution of the paper is in the development of an approach that ensures the low power required by the robot by selecting the best robot joint configuration for object placement and providing intelligent control of robot joints for object-picking. The proposed and tested methodology is based on the mutual solution of the forward kinematics, inverse kinematics, inverse statics, and reinforcement learning problems in robotics. An appropriate neural-network-based controller is designed. In this work, model development, simulation, and experimental stages are described. As a result, several MATLAB/Simulink√¢‚Äû¬¢ models and simulation methods are designed for efficient robot control and an appropriate neural-network-based controller is developed. The experiment conducted on the IRB1600 robot demonstrates that up to 18% of the consumed power may be saved thanks to an optimally chosen joint configuration."

This ongoing process of land concentration can affect Europe's small farms and rural areas. The EU has acknowledged that the problem is serious and that, to solve it, it must be studied more closely. Accordingly, the aim of this study is to discuss changes in the agricultural sector from the aspect of land use, with emphasis on land concentration in Estonia, further scientific discussion about the effects of changes in land use on rural areas is encouraged. The study is carried out using two kinds of data sources: (1) statistical data from Eurostat, FAOSTAT and Statistics Estonia, (2) data from the Estonian Agricultural Registers and Information Board. The conclusion of the paper is that while the number of farms is going down, the average area of agricultural land use per farm is on the rise in Estonia. Agricultural land has been increasingly concentrated into the hands of corporate bodies. This study shows that there is a status of land concentration in Estonia that needs ongoing studies and a proper policy should be established to mitigate the impact of land concentration."

This research presents the optimization technique that gives a mathematically proven solution of the optimal rotor design of a synchronous reluctance machine obtained by using metamodels in the form of local polynomial approximations. Analysis of the results of numerical modeling and experimental investigation has been performed in order to validate the developed technique and recommendations. SynRM rotor was manufactured, with the stator to be taken from the 1.1 kW W21 WEG induction motor, which makes possible the relevant experimental study.

Besides just describing the cytotoxic properties of plant constituents, their molecular mechanisms of action in different cancer types are equally important. Therefore, this review article focuses on the role of theScutellariaflavones wogonin, baicalein, baicalin, scutellarein and scutellarin in regulating the autophagic machinery in diverse cancer models, highlighting these molecules as potential lead compounds for the fight against malignant neoplasms. The knowledge that autophagy can function as a dual-edged sword, acting in both a pro- and antitumorigenic manner, further complicates the issue, revealing an amazing property of flavonoids that behave either as anti- or proautophagic agents."

Lack of relay's proper testing provokes an unpredictability in its behavior, that may prompt tripping of a healthy power system. Therefore, the main contribution of the paper is to prepare a step-by-step comprehensive procedural guideline for practical implementation of relay testing procedures and a detailed insight analysis of relay's settings for the protection of an Extra High Voltage (EHV) auto transformer. The experimental results are scrutinized to document a detailed theoretical and technical analysis. Moreover, the paper also covers shortcomings of existing literature by documenting specialized literature that covers all aspects of protection relays, i.e., from basics of electromechanical domain to the technicalities of the numerical differential relay covering its detailed testing from different reputed manufacturers. A secondary injection relay test set is used for detailed testing of differential relay under test, and the S1 Agile software is used for protection relay settings, configuration modification, and detailed analysis."

Applications range from prototyping to small-scale production, with 3D printing offering reduced logistics overheads, better design flexibility and ease of use compared with traditional fabrication methods. In addition, printer and material costs have also decreased rapidly. These advantages make 3D printing attractive for application in microfluidic chip fabrication. However, 3D printing microfluidics is still a new area. Is the technology mature enough to print complex microchannel geometries, such as droplet microfluidics? Can 3D-printed droplet microfluidic chips be used in biological or chemical applications? Is 3D printing mature enough to be used in every research lab? These are the questions we will seek answers to in our systematic review. We will analyze (1) the key performance metrics of 3D-printed droplet microfluidics and (2) existing biological or chemical application areas. In addition, we evaluate (3) the potential of large-scale application of 3D printing microfluidics. Finally, (4) we discuss how 3D printing and digital design automation could trivialize microfluidic chip fabrication in the long term. Based on our analysis, we can conclude that today, 3D printers could already be used in every research lab. Printing droplet microfluidics is also a possibility, albeit with some challenges discussed in this review."

It is difficult to manage and control the volume of data used in cloud computing, and since cloud computing has problems with latency, lack of mobility, and location knowledge, it is not suitable for IoT applications such as healthcare or vehicle systems. To overcome these problems, fog computing (FC) has been used; it consists of a set of fog devices (FDs) with heterogeneous and distributed resources that are located between the user layer and the cloud on the edge of the network. An application in FC is divided into several modules. The allocation of processing elements (PEs) to modules is a scheduling problem. In this paper, some heuristic and meta-heuristic algorithms are analyzed, and a Hyper-Heuristic Scheduling (HHS) algorithm is presented to find the best allocation with respect to low latency and energy consumption. HHS allocates PEs to modules by low-level heuristics in the training and testing phases of the input workflow. Based on simulation results and comparison of HHS with traditional, heuristic, and meta-heuristic algorithms, the proposed method has improvements in energy consumption, total execution cost, latency, and total execution time."

In this work, we consider multi-hop Device-to-Device (D2D) communication in a hybrid infrastructure where OSA UEs connect to each other in a seamless manner in order to disseminate critical information to a deployed command center. The challenge that we address is to simultaneously keep the OSA UEs alive as long as possible and send the critical information to a final destination (e.g., a command center) as rapidly as possible, while considering the heterogeneous characteristics of the OSA UEs. We propose a dynamic adaptation approach based on machine learning to improve a joint energy-spectral efficiency (ESE). We apply a Q-learning scheme in a hybrid fashion (partially distributed and centralized) in learner agents (distributed OSA UEs) and scheduler agents (remote radio heads or RRHs), for which the next hop selection and RRH selection algorithms are proposed. Our simulation results show that the proposed dynamic adaptation approach outperforms the baseline system by approximately67%in terms of joint energy-spectral efficiency, wherein the energy efficiency of the OSA UEs benefit from a gain of approximately30%. Finally, the results show also that our proposed framework with C-RAN reduces latency by approximately50%w.r.t. the baseline."

The current recycling practices of tungsten carbide (WC)-based scraps have been accepted as economically and partially environmentally beneficial and can promote tungsten closed-loop recycling; however, low functional recycling rates and significant metal losses at varied stages hinder the economic recovery of metals. The current review presents the global situation of tungsten and WC flow with a focus on various sustainable methods to recycle spent tungsten and related metals. A detailed discussion of establishing a highly resilient circular economy with sustainable development goals is highlighted by juxtaposing the philosophy of the circular economy, integrated sustainability, and the metal life cycle approach. The article also discusses Industry 5.0 trends, such as sustainable digitalization and twin transition, to overcome the barriers associated with achieving efficient circular recycling. It is shown that cross-disciplinary methodologies, the integration of diverse technologies (digital/green), and the incorporation of state-of-the-art recycling techniques open up the future potential in the recycling sector."

In this paper we derive general transformation rules into the coincident gauge for spacetime configurations where the both the metric and connection are static and spherically symmetric, and write out the respective form of the coincident gauge metrics. Taking different options in fixing the freedom in the connection allowed by the symmetry and the field equations, the Schwarzschild metric in the coincident gauge can take for instance the Cartesian, Kerr&Schild, and diagonal (isotropic-like) forms, while the BBMB black hole metric in symmetric teleparallel scalar&tensor theory a certain diagonal form fits the coincident gauge requirements but the Cartesian and Kerr&Schild forms do not. Different connections imply different value for the boundary term which could in principle be physically relevant, but simple arguments about the coincident gauge do not seem to be sufficient to fix the connection uniquely. As a byproduct of the investigation we also point out that only a particular subset of static spherically symmetric connections has vanishing nonmetricity in the Minkowski limit."

By focusing on the two most-similar cases of right-wing populist governments in the region‚Äînamely, Hungary and Poland, this paper documents a striking attempt by Poland‚Äôs Law and Justice party to use increases in the minimum wage and social security contributions as a developmentalist tool that should force domestically owned firms to achieve greater efficiency and technological upgrading. In sharp contrast, Hungary‚Äôs Fidesz party has systematically compensated minimum wage increases with cuts in employer social contributions and has refrained from assigning developmentalist aims to labor cost increases. Both parties have cultivated a cross-class electoral base and have faced electoral trade-offs in emphasizing minimum wage increases.

Our main research question is as follows: How would it be possible to use democratic citizenship education to decrease in the future the socio-economic inequality between different communities in Estonia? We will outline the context of ethnic socio-economic inequality in Estonia and show how these differences have been at least partially influenced by the current education system in Estonia and how citizenship education can be used to reduce these inequalities in the future. We will conduct an empirical analysis of the curriculum, and this will be followed by semi-structured qualitative interviews. In the discussion, we will make suggestions to the current Estonian citizenship education policy and offer various insights into tackling this issue."

The development of tourism can be a key factor in recovery and economic growth. Geospatial platforms for interactive charitable tourism offer a promising solution for attracting tourists and stimulating the development of affected regions. The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of geospatial platforms for interactive charitable tourism as a tool for attracting tourists and promoting the recovery and development of regions affected by armed conflicts. This study employed regression and correlation analysis methods. The analysis revealed significant positive correlations for all variables. The correlation coefficient for audience reach was 0.75, for the effectiveness of attracting donations: 0.8, for the economic impact on the region: 0.9, for user interaction with the platform: 0.85, for platform sustainability: 0.78, and for social impact: 0.92. The t-statistic values exceeded the critical thresholds, and the p-values were below 0.05, confirming the statistical significance of the results. The coefficient of determination was 0.91, indicating a high explanatory power of the model. For the four obtained clusters, approaches to the development and use of geospatial platforms were justified. For regions of Cluster 1 with high audience reach (0.75) and moderate effectiveness of attracting donations (0.8), it is recommended to use technologies to improve connectivity and effectively promote their strengths. For regions of Cluster 2 with high sustainability and high tourism potential (high social impact = 0.92), it is necessary to include advanced geospatial solutions to increase visitor engagement and optimize recovery strategies, building on existing strengths to attract more tourists and stimulate sustainable development. For regions of Cluster 3, significant investments are required both in geospatial platforms and in tourism infrastructure to benefit from high tourism potential (economic impact on the region = 0.9). Strategic development and targeted marketing should be a priority to attract tourists and stimulate economic growth. Regions of Cluster 4 with low sustainability and tourism potential (low user interaction with the platform = 0.85 and platform sustainability = 0.78) require comprehensive support, as they are in a crisis situation."

Antimicrobial high-touch surfaces that kill microbes on contact or prevent their adhesion could be considered to mitigate the spread. Here, we demonstrate that photocatalytic nano-ZnO- and nano-ZnO/Ag-based antibacterial surfaces with efficacy of at least a 2.7-log reduction inEscherichia coliandStaphylococcus aureusviability in 2 h can be produced by simple measures using a commercial acrylic topcoat for wood surfaces. We characterize the surfaces taking into account cyclic wear and variable environmental conditions. The light-induced antibacterial and photocatalytic activities of the surfaces are enhanced by short-term cyclic wear, indicating their potential for prolonged effectivity in long-term use. As the produced surfaces are generally more effective at higher relative air humidity and silver-containing surfaces lost their contact-killing properties in dry conditions, it is important to critically evaluate the end-use conditions of materials and surfaces to be tested and select application-appropriate methods for their efficacy assessment."

This case study explores the concept of the FoF and its role in driving the energy transition and digital transformation within the automotive sector. By embracing advancements in technology and innovation, these factories aim to establish a smart, sustainable, inclusive, and resilient growth framework. The shift towards hybrid and electric vehicles necessitates significant adjustments in vehicle components and production processes. To achieve this, the adoption of lighter materials becomes imperative, and new technologies such as additive manufacturing (AM) and artificial intelligence (AI) are being adopted, facilitating enhanced efficiency and innovation within the factory environment. An important aspect of this paradigm involves the development and utilization of a modular, affordable, safe human&robot interaction and highly performant intelligent robot. The introduction of this intelligent robot aims to foster a higher degree of automation and efficiency through collaborative human&robot environments on the factory floor and production lines, specifically tailored to the automotive sector. By combining the strengths of human and robotic capabilities, the future factory aims to revolutionize manufacturing processes, ultimately driving the automotive industry towards a more sustainable and technologically advanced future. This study explores the implementation of automation and the initial strides toward transitioning from Industry 4.0 to 5.0, focusing on three recognized, large, and automotive companies operating in the north of Portugal."

Therefore, we aim to identify the factors that affect public-private partnership (PPP) in the field of eID. We also describe feasible formats that help to improve the cooperation between the two sectors, based on insights from the case of Estonia. In service of that study, we conducted twelve qualitative interviews with high-level experts representing several parties from the public and the private sector. By conducting a thematic analysis of the interviews, we identified five key factors for successful PPP in the eID field, i.e., engagement, joint understanding, two-way communication, clear role division, and process orientation. Furthermore, we generalize our results by discussing, in how far the found cooperation formats can be used by stakeholders to manage state-critical information technology (IT) infrastructure components similar to eID such as mobile phone services, data transmission services and digital signature services."

During the following semester, distance learning was partially continued, but lecturers were now able to base their work on the experiences gained during the emergency situation and instructions prepared by the teaching support staff. However, students' perceptions should be also taken into account as several studies have shown that student feedback and evaluations help teachers better plan courses and tailor them to their wishes and needs, to increase student satisfaction and quality of learning (Secret et al., 2016;Mandal, 2019). In addition, it should be considered that when staying at home, students' ability to concentrate on schoolwork and external motivation to engage in learning activities can be negatively affected by the fact that students can feel stressed, anxious, bored, and unproductive (Di Pietro et al., 2020;Scull et al., 2020). Students' attitudes toward web lessons have been studied in the past, but the results have been contradictory, which may be due to disciplinary differences. In addition, it has not been explored what student engagement strategies in web lessons are important for students who are struggling with screen fatigue and with difficulties motivating themselves and concentrating on web lessons. However, understanding the connections between fatigue, motivation, concentration, and engagement strategies is important in planning future education including web lessons and providing better learning experiences in distance learning without harming students' mental health."

This paper discusses the benefits and challenges of using online focus groups with participants representing different generations and cultural and social backgrounds. Based on the researchers‚Äô experiences and field notes from a three-country comparative project, aiming at analysing the extent to which previous experience of state surveillance impacted attitudes to commercial monitoring and tracking of online behaviour among two generational cohorts, the paper identifies seven aspects where the move from offline to online interviewing interfered with the original research design. The paper suggests that most of these interferences resulted in a need to adjust the methodology to better fit the online setting. We reflect critically upon the issues of technological preconditions and digital skills, recruitment, group size, degrees of previous acquaintance, the role of the interviewer, participants‚Äô household status and media environment, and ethical considerations concerning privacy and data management. Based on these methodological insights, we conclude that future online focus group research would benefit from using smaller groups and adjusted moderation, flexibility in interviewing tools and channels, and new, online-specific ethical considerations when planning, executing, and analysing interviews. The paper advocates the complementarity between inperson and online focus groups as two modalities of data collection and argues for the normalization of hybrid methods."

Moreover, the impact of operating temperature, relative humidity, and additional UV irradiation as changes in the sensing environment have been explored towards their impact on sensing properties. Finally, a cross-laboratory study is presented, supporting stable sensor responses, and the final data is merged into a simplified sensor array. This study shows that sensors can be tailored not only by using different materials but also by applying different working conditions, according to the requirements of certain applications. Lastly, a combination of several different sensors into a sensor array leads to a well-performing sensor system that, with further development, could be suitable for several applications where there is no solution on the market today."

The solution that John Venn developed for this problem, however, came from a completely different area of logic: instead of orienting to syllogistic like Euler diagrams, Venn applied Boolean algebra to improve visual reasoning. Venn's contribution to solving the problem of elimination also played an important role. The result of this development is still known today as the √¢‚Ç¨ÀúVenn Diagram'."

First, a full-order observer is presented to provide the stator current and the rotor flux. Then, an adaptive control law is designed using the Lyapunov stability theorem to estimate the rotor speed. In parallel, a stator resistance identification scheme is proposed using more degrees of freedom of the 6PIM, which is also based on the Lyapunov stability theorem. The main advantage of the proposed method is that the stator resistance adaptation is completely decoupled from the rotor speed estimation algorithm. To increase the robustness of the drive system against external disturbances, noises, and parameter uncertainties, an active disturbance rejection controller (ADRC) is introduced in direct torque control (DTC) of the 6PIM. The experimental results clarify the effectiveness of the proposed approaches."

Embedded buck&boost functionality enables these converters to regulate the input voltage and load in a wide range, which makes them suitable for such demanding application as photovoltaic microconverters. The isolation transformer here plays a central role as its turns ratio defines the point of transition between the boost and buck modes and overall capability of the converter to regulate the input voltage in a wide range at high efficiency. The studied quasi-Z-source galvanically isolated DC-DC converter is benchmarked in terms of power loss of components and weighted power conversion efficiency for three different turns ratios of isolation transformer to achieve the best and optimized turns ratio lead to the efficient operation. Operation in a wide range of input voltage at high efficiency is the main criterion for assessing the effect of turns ratio on the efficiency of the converter. The proposed loss model and theoretical predictions of the efficiency were validated with the help of a 300 W experimental prototype of the photovoltaic microconverter based on the quasi-Z-source galvanically isolated DC-DC converter topology."

The digitalization and harmonization of stormwater management through the implementation of e-monitoring (online or continuous monitoring) allow for the collection of data. This data can be used to improve stormwater quality and quantity management, thereby reducing the environmental harm induced by anthropogenic activities. Based on the literature review, supporting tables and matrices are proposed to assist decision-makers and other interested parties in developing and implementing √¢‚Ç¨≈ìsmart√¢‚Ç¨¬ù stormwater management solutions. In this article, we demonstrate that such systems can enhance stormwater management and system performance by leveraging data-driven operation and maintenance. Another advantage of the approach is that it contributes to a healthier urban environment and ecosystem well-being."

Clonal relationships of the strains were determined by whole-genome sequencing and analyzed by multi-locus sequence typing. We determined the presence of acquired antimicrobial resistance genes and 23S rRNA mutations, virulence genes, and also the plasmid or chromosomal origin of the genes using dedicated DNA sequence analysis tools available and/or homology search against anad hoccompiled database of relevant sequences. TwoE. faecalisisolates from human withvanBgenes were highly resistant to vancomycin. Closely relatedE. faecalisstrains were isolated from different host species. This indicates interspecies spread of strains and potential transfer of antibiotic resistance. Genomic context analysis of the resistance genes indicated frequent association with plasmids and mobile genetic elements. Resistance genes are often present in the identical genetic context in strains with diverse origins, suggesting the occurrence of transfer events."

The statistical analysis revealed that there was a strong correlation between the daily average surface air temperature of the studied cities (range: 0.95&0.99). We analyzed the frequency distribution of the average surface air temperatures in addition to the Kruskal&Wallis and Dunn's tests (significance level of 0.05) to demonstrate that the difference in air temperatures between Narva, Tallinn, Tartu, and Stockholm are critical. The Welch'st-test (significance level 0.05), used to study the differences in the average monthly air temperature of the cities in question, showed that the surface air temperatures in Stockholm do not differ from Tallinn air temperatures from May to August. However, the surface air temperatures of Narva were similar to those of Tallinn in September. According to our results, the trends in the changes of monthly average surface air temperatures have a certain course during the year (ranging from 1.8 √Ç¬∞C (Stockholm) to 4.5 √Ç¬∞C (V√µru and Tartu) per decade in February). During the entire study period, in addition to February, the surface air temperature increased in all the studied cities in March, May, June, and December, and the surface air temperature did not increase in January or from July to October. During the study period, the average annual surface air temperature in the cities of the central Baltic area increased by 0.43 √Ç¬∞C per decade. The results also confirm that the surface air temperature in the study area is changing differently in different cities. The acceleration of the surface air temperature is very alarming and requires a significant intensification of the measures taken to slow down the temperature rise."

We expand previous accounts of these manner expressions (MEs) in quotative constructions and investigate their use with epistemic (‚Äòknow‚Äô, ‚Äòguess‚Äô) and perceptive (‚Äòsee‚Äô, ‚Äòhear‚Äô, ‚Äòfeel‚Äô) verbs in non-standard written communications. In addition to the results from two Finnic languages, in the discussion of this article, we pay attention to the similarities found in the use of MEs with these verbs in Finno-Ugric languages spoken in Russia. The results show that MEs contribute to the expression of epistemic processes and perception in both languages. Manner demonstratives are used as endophoric markers pointing at demonstrations and descriptions of the event perceived. Co-occurring with the epistemic verb ‚Äòknow‚Äô, manner demonstratives induce a non-factive construal and cancel the presupposition that the speaker considers the proposition to be true. With inherently subjective verbs like ‚Äòunderstand‚Äô and in some contexts with perceptive verbs like ‚Äòsee, seem‚Äô, and ‚Äòfeel‚Äô, they indicate the subjective interpretation of the event. The reportative function is observed with the auditory perceptive verbs ‚Äòhear‚Äô and ‚Äòbe heard‚Äô, where the manner demonstratives highlight the reporter‚Äôs uncertainty or indicate the verbatim rendering of the report. Furthermore, they can express the speaker‚Äôs wishful thinking while co-occurring with a visual perceptive verb ‚Äòsee‚Äô. In turn, similative markers are used in reportative function as already established quotatives and mark reports as approximately reproduced or typical for the event described.

Regarding the epiphytic growth, macrophytes were more overgrown in the relatively less productive (northern) site with a muddy bottom and more frequent marine water inflow than in the (southern) site with higher productivity and freshwater sandy habitat. Stable isotope analysis revealed that organisms' samples from the northern site were more enriched with the heavier carbon isotopes, but depleted in the heavier nitrogen isotopes than those from the southern site. Gastropods and amphipods mainly consumed sedimentary organic matter in the southern site, while they grazed epiphytes together with sedimentary organic matter in the northern site. Although to a low extent, gastropods consumed more charophytes than pondweeds in the southern site. This study contributes to a better understanding of the functioning and structure of lagoonal systems, highlighting the importance, often overlooked, of the benthic compartment, which, however, may have a relevant influence on the productivity of the whole system."

We consider four topics in this context: energy trading, energy balancing, grid planning, and system reliability, and we demonstrate the advantages of using game-theoretic approaches for analyzing complex interactions among independent players. The results and conclusions provide insights regarding many aspects of design and operation, such as efficient methodologies for expansion planning, cyber-security, and frequency stability, or fair-benefit allocation among players. A central conclusion is that modeling the system from the perspective of one entity with unlimited information and control span is often impractical, so correct modeling of the selfish behavior of independent players may be critical for the development of future power systems. Another conclusion is that correct usage of incentives by appropriate regulation or sophisticated pricing mechanisms may improve the social welfare, and, in several cases, the results obtained are as good as those obtained by central planning. Using an extensive content analysis, we point to several trends in the current research and attempt to identify the research directions that are currently at the focus of the community."

The voltage fluctuations between the neutral point of the grid and the PV array, i.e., common-mode voltage (CMV), will affect the value of the leakage currents. Therefore, the leakage currents can be attenuated through proper control of the CMV. The CMV depends on the converter topology and the modulation strategy. For the quasi-Z-source inverter (qZSI), the amplitude of the high-frequency components in the CMV increases due to the extra shoot-through (ST) state. The CMV reduction strategies for the conventional voltage source inverter (VSI) should be modified when applied to the qZSI. In this paper, an input-split-inductor qZSI is introduced to reduce the CMV, in which all the CMV reduction strategies for the VSI can be used directly with appropriate ST state insertion. Moreover, the proposed method can be extended to impedance source converters with a similar structure. Simulations and experimental tests demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy for the qZSI in terms of CMV reduction."

We found that value types can be ordered along the two dimensions of resources and change. The comparison between countries revealed that some dimensions, like social diversity and sustainability evaluations, are more universally valued among individuals, countries, and domains.

The demand for high-quality wood species necessitates exploring alternative, underutilized wood sources due to limited forest areas and premium wood volume. Consequently, the veneer-based industry is considering lower-value hardwood species like grey alder (Alnus Incania), black alder (Alnus glutinosa), and aspen (Populus tremula) as substitutes for high-quality birch (Betula pendula). Initially less appealing due to their lower density and mechanical properties, these species show promise through densification, which enhances their density, strength, and hardness. This study aims to enhance plywood screw withdrawal capacity and surface hardness by densifying low-density wood species and using them in plywood face-veneer layers, or in all layers. The relationship between the wood density, surface hardness, and screw withdrawal capacity of plywood made of low-value species like aspen and black alder is examined. Experimental work with a pilot-scale veneer and plywood production line demonstrates improved surface hardness (65% and 93% for aspen and black alder, respectively) and screw withdrawal capacity (16% and 35% for aspen and black alder, respectively) in densified face veneer plywood. This research highlights the potential of densified low-value wood species to meet construction requirements, expanding their practical applications."

Despite years of solubility research, molecular structure-based prediction of the intrinsic aqueous solubility of drug substances is still under active investigation. This paper describes the authors' systematic data-driven modelling in which two fit-for-purpose training data sets for intrinsic aqueous solubility were collected and curated, and three quantitative structure&property relationships were derived to make predictions for the most recent solubility challenge. All three models perform well individually, while being mechanistically transparent and easy to understand. Molecular descriptors involved in the models are related to the following key steps in the solubility process: dissociation of the molecule from the crystal, formation of a cavity in the solvent, and insertion of the molecule into the solvent. A consensus modeling approach with these models remarkably improved prediction capability and reduced the number of strong outliers by more than two times. The performance and outliers of the second solubility challenge predictions were analyzed retrospectively. All developed models have been published in the QsarDB.org repository according to FAIR principles and can be used without restrictions for exploring, downloading, and making predictions."

We derived an EQ-5D-3L value set by regressing the TTO values on the ten impairment levels in the EQ-5D-3L. We explored the potential for response shift and whether preferences for domains vary systematically with prior impairment in that domain. Finally, we compared the value set to 25 other EQ-5D-3L preference-based value sets.ResultsTTO data were available for 12,954 EQ-5D-3L health states in 4683 patients. All coefficients in the value set had the expected sign, were statistically significant, and increased monotonically with severity of impairment. We found evidence for response shift in mobility, self-care, and usual activities. The value set had good agreement with the only other experience- and preference-based value set, but poor agreement with all hypothetical value sets.ConclusionsWe present an experience- and preference-based value set with high face validity. The study indicates that response shift may be important to account for when deriving value sets. Furthermore, the study suggests that perspective (experienced versus hypothetical) is more important than country setting or demographics for valuation of EQ-5D-3L health states."

Action is needed to increase their abundance if more sustainable agricultural systems are to be achieved. Conservation biological control (CBC) is a key component of integrated pest management yet has failed to be widely adopted in mainstream agriculture. Approaches to improving conservation biological control have been largely ad hoc. Two approaches are described to improve this process, one based upon pest natural enemy ecology and resource provision while the other focusses on the ecosystem service delivery using the QuESSA (Quantification of Ecological Services for Sustainable Agriculture) project as an example. In this project, a predictive scoring system was developed to show the potential of five seminatural habitat categories to provide biological control, from which predictive maps were generated for Europe. Actual biological control was measured in a series of case studies using sentinel systems (insect or seed prey), trade-offs between ecosystem services were explored, and heatmaps of biological control were generated. The overall conclusion from the QuESSA project was that results were context specific, indicating that more targeted approaches to CBC are needed. This may include designing new habitats or modifying existing habitats to support the types of natural enemies required for specific crops or pests."

Therefore, new ILs are being developed and adapted as innovative chemical environments for different applications in which their properties need to be understood on a molecular level. Computational data-driven methods provide means for understanding of properties at molecular level, and quantitative structure&property relationships (QSPRs) provide the framework for this. This framework is commonly used to study the properties of molecules in ILs as an environment. The opposite situation where the property is considered as a function of the ionic liquid does not exist. The aim of the present study was to supplement this perspective with new knowledge and to develop QSPRs that would allow the understanding of molecular interactions in ionic liquids based on the structure of the cationic moiety. A wide range of applications in electrochemistry, separation and extraction chemistry depends on the partitioning of solutes between the ionic liquid and the surrounding environment that is characterized by the gas-ionic liquid partition coefficient. To model this property as a function of the structure of a cationic counterpart, a series of ionic liquids was selected with a common bis-(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)-imide anion, [Tf2N]√¢ÀÜ‚Äô, for benzene, hexane and cyclohexane. MLR, SVR and GPR machine learning approaches were used to derive data-driven models and their performance was compared. The cross-validation coefficients of determination in the range 0.71&0.93 along with other performance statistics indicated a strong accuracy of models for all data series and machine learning methods. The analysis and interpretation of descriptors revealed that generally higher lipophilicity and dispersion interaction capability, and lower polarity in the cations induces a higher partition coefficient for benzene, hexane, cyclohexane and hydrocarbons in general. The applicability domain analysis of models concluded that there were no highly influential outliers and the models are applicable to a wide selection of cation families with variable size, polarity and aliphatic or aromatic nature."

In the transition from research outcome to innovation, information about the entrepreneurial opportunity is important because the outcomes of academic research are distant from the marketplace: as they have not been conceived with consideration of practical use but solely in a quest for understanding a scientific phenomenon. This underpins the rationale for our study into the information conditions regarding the entrepreneurial opportunity in the context of the prevailing property rights regime. In addressing this issue we adopt a theory-led realist synthesis approach to the conduct of a systematic literature review. Whilst we find empirical evidence supporting the conclusions of theoretical models, i.e. the strengthening role of technology transfer offices, we also point to their shortcomings. We go on to argue that significant gaps in our knowledge, and thus our ability to act, remain. In response, we advance an agenda for future research that focuses on the exploration of alternative policy actions (interventions) that draw from different paradigmatic lenses and methodological approaches."

Numerous preclinical studies have shown a strong anticancer potential of structurally different phytochemicals, including polyphenolic constituents of plants, flavonoids. In this review article, suppressing effects of equol in different carcinogenesis models are unraveled, highlighting the mechanisms involved in these anticancer activities. Among flavonoids, daidzein is a well-known isoflavone occurring in soybeans and soy products. In a certain part of population, this soy isoflavone is decomposed to equol under the action of gut microflora. Somewhat surprisingly, this degradation product has been shown to be more bioactive than its precursor daidzein, revealing a strong and multifaceted anticancer potential. In this way, it is important to bear in mind that the metabolic conversion of plant flavonoids might lead to products that are even more efficient than the parent compounds themselves, definitely deserving further studies."

In this paper, we explore the impact of ESG ratings on such asymmetric behavior of volatility. For this analysis, we use the return data, ESG ratings, and solvency ratios of the constituent stocks of S&P Europe 350 for the period January 2016&December 2021. We apply autoregressive moving average models for the conditional means and GARCH and stochastic volatility models for the conditional variances to estimate the asymmetry coefficients. Afterwards, these coefficients are regressed via Arellano&Bond and lagged first difference methods to estimate the impact of ESG ratings. Our findings confirm that stocks of riskier firms are more likely to suffer from asymmetry behavior of volatility. We also confirm that firm leverage is linked to this asymmetry behavior. We found evidence that the impact of ESG ratings was negative before COVID-19, but positive afterwards. For some sectors, higher ESG ratings are linked to higher asymmetry. Finally, we found that during COVID-19, the asymmetry behavior became more pronounced."

It has been detected that farm size greatly influences agricultural sustainability from the viewpoints of the economy, environment, and society. Land concentration is negatively affecting the development of rural communities. Similar to other European countries, Estonia is undergoing agricultural land concentration. One way to stop the further concentration of agricultural land is to set an upper limit to land acquisition (similar to that in Latvia and Lithuania). This paper aimed to determine what kind of regulations concerning agricultural land use and ownership Estonia needs to restrain land concentration. Four sources of data were used for this research: statistical data from Statistics Estonia, the data for the land holdings of agricultural producers from the Estonian Agricultural Registers and Information Board, data from the Land Registry and available literature. The outcome of the study confirmed that Estonia requires policy direction and regulations for the agricultural land market, that would help to lighten the impact of land concentration in rural areas in the long run, similar to several other European countries."

In this paper, we review the literature on using machine learning to cope with challenges associated with spatial autocorrelation. Our focus was on studies in which researchers predicted environmental variables using a supervised machine learning regression algorithm that accounted for spatial autocorrelation in any part of the modeling pipeline from data exploration to model validation. Methods included explicit spatial covariates, data splitting for training‚Äìtesting, model calculations, and independent exploratory analysis. Authors accounted for spatial autocorrelation most often in the independent exploratory analysis which had no impact on the predicted values.

We concluded that there seems to be no overall systematic approach on how to account for spatial autocorrelation in machine learning models. In the selected studies, the most appropriate spatial method depended on the specific characteristics of the study. Using explicit spatial covariates and data splitting for training-testing provided more insights into a method's applicability. We summarize these insights and provide considerations for selecting the most appropriate method."

To improve the H2release and storage properties of LiAlH4, confinement in porous media decreases the temperature of H2release and improves the kinetics, where considerably improved H2release properties are accompanied by a loss in the total amount of H2released. The capability of mesoporous carbon black to improve the H2storage properties of confined LiAlH4is investigated with temperature-programmed desorption and time-stability measurements using X-ray diffraction and N2gas adsorption measurements to characterize the composite materials' composition and structure. Here, we present the capability of commercial carbon black to effectively lower the onset temperature of H2release to that of near-ambient, √¢‚Ä∞¬•295 K. In addition, the confinement in mesoporous carbon black destabilized LiAlH4to a degree that during √¢‚Ä∞¬§14 days in storage, under Ar atmosphere and at ambient temperature, 40% of the theoretically contained H2was lost due to decomposition. Thus, we present the possibility of destabilizing LiAlH4to a very high degree and, thus, avoiding the melting step before H2release at around 440 K using scaffold materials with fine-tuned porosities."

Panel data consisting of 392 Estonian farms covering the years 2014 to 2019 were used to study the relationship between the farm structure measured by the area-weighted mean size of the parcels and the probability of implementing innovation activity. The result of the logit model with fixed effects shows that the structure of the farm and the probability to invest in buildings, machinery, equipment, and inventory are positively related. Small LGs can use this intervention for various aims and must consider environmental goals, country-specific planning systems, legislation, and farm owners‚Äô willingness to participate in land consolidation."

There has been more meaningful research performed in controlled boundary condition situations than in actual work environments involving occupants. Thermal comfort conditions in office buildings in Estonia have been barely investigated in the past. In this paper, the results of thermal comfort and draught rate assessment in five office buildings in Tallinn are presented and discussed. Studied office landscapes vary in heating, ventilation and cooling system parameters, room units, and elements. All sample buildings were less than six years old, equipped with dedicated outdoor air ventilation system and room conditioning units. The on-site measurements consisted of thermal comfort and draught rate assessment with indoor climate questionnaire. The purpose of the survey is to assess the correspondence between heating, ventilation and cooling system design, and the actual situation. Results show, whether and in what extent the standard-based criteria for thermal comfort is suitable for actual usage of the occupants. Preferring one room conditioning unit type or system may not guarantee better thermal environment without draught. Although some heating, ventilation and cooling systems observed in this study should create the prerequisites for ensuring more comfort, results show that this is not the case for all buildings in this study."

The black shale is highly enriched in U, V, Mo, and Pb (except in samples from Sweden where Pb is slightly enriched), slightly enriched in SiO2, Fe2O3, K2O, and TiO2and highly depleted in CaO, Na2O, and MnO, with respect to average shales. The provenance signatures (Th/Sc versus Zr/Sc, Al2O3versus TiO2, Zr versus TiO2plots, and Zr/Sc ratio) of the Baltoscandian black shales suggest that they were derived from rocks of intermediate to felsic composition and from recycled sediments. The likely provenance region was the Paleoproterozoic igneous and metamorphic basement of southern central and southern Finland, which consists predominantly of felsic to intermediate metamorphic (acidic to intermediate gneisses, felsic volcanics, microcline granites and migmatites) and igneous rocks (small granitic intrusions and large rapakivi granite intrusions), and reworked older Ediacaran and Lower Cambrian sediments; however, the proportion of clastic input from these sources is not uniform in the three regions studied. The discrimination of the tectonic settings of source materials of the black shale using the SiO2versus K2O/Na2O plot and a new discriminant method (APMdisc) favors a passive margin setting. The Chemical Index of Weathering (CIW) indicates that the clastic material in the black shale of the studied regions has experienced an intense degree of chemical weathering. Weathering indices (Chemical Index of Alteration CIA and CIW) also show that the black shale has experienced significant secondary potassium enrichment."

We conducted a prospective clinical study in patients with type 2 diabetes requiring treatment intensification. Ten patients were assigned to receive empagliflozin 10 mg and 10 patients to receive s/c semaglutide (titrated to 1 mg once a week) in a non-randomised manner. All parameters were measured at baseline and after 3 months. Fasting plasma glucose and glycated haemoglobin improved significantly in both treatment groups, with no between-group differences. Body weight and body mass index reduced significantly more in the semaglutide group, whereas waist circumference decreased only in the empagliflozin group. There was a trend for high-sensitivity CRP reduction in both treatment groups that did not reach statistical significance. Interleukin-6 and the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio did not change in either group. Ferritin and uric acid decreased significantly only in the empagliflozin group, and ceruloplasmin decreased significantly only in the semaglutide group. Though there were clinically meaningful improvements in diabetes control in both treatment arms, we could detect only minor changes in some inflammatory markers."

Our paper proposes a novel approach to speech processing that can resolve the gender bias problem by eliminating the gender parameter. Therefore, we devised a system that transforms the input sound (speech of a person) into a neutralized voice to the point where the gender of the speaker becomes indistinguishable by both humans and AI. Wav2Vec based network has been utilised to conduct speech gender recognition to validate the main claim of this research work, which is the neutralisation of gender from the speech. Such a system can be used as a batch pre-processing layer for training models, thus making associated gender bias irrelevant. Further, such a system can also find its application where speaker gender bias by humans is also prominent, as the listener will not be able to judge the gender from speech."

In the present study, ZE10 Mg-alloy-based nanocomposites reinforced with graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) having a thickness of 10&20 nm were fabricated via ultrasound-assisted stir casting. The effect of GNP contents (0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 wt.%) on the microstructure, Vickers hardness, and tensile properties of nanocomposites was investigated. Further, tribological studies were performed under a ball-on-disc sliding wear configuration against a bearing ball counterbody, at room and elevated temperatures of 100 √Ç¬∞C and 200 √Ç¬∞C, to comprehend temperature-induced wear mechanisms and friction evolution. It was revealed that the GNP addition resulted in grain coarsening and increased porosity rate of the Mg alloy. While the composites exhibited improved hardness by 20&35% at room temperature and 100 √Ç¬∞C, a minor change was observed in their hardness and tensile yield strength values at 200 √Ç¬∞C with respect to the GNP-free alloy. A notable improvement in lowering and stabilizing friction (coefficient of friction at 200 √Ç¬∞C~0.25) and wear values was seen for the self-lubricating GNP-added composites at all sliding temperatures. The worn surface morphology indicated a simultaneous occurrence of abrasive and adhesive wear mode in all samples at room temperature and 100 √Ç¬∞C, while delamination and smearing along with debris compaction (tribolayer protection) were the dominant mechanisms of wear at 200 √Ç¬∞C. Inclusively, the results advocate steady frictional conditions, improved wear resistance, and favorable wear-protective mechanisms for the Mg alloy&GNP nanocomposites at room and elevated temperatures."

The models were parameterized using high-quality territory-mapping data from Estonia. I considered three approaches for obtaining the model parameters. Of these, (i) a formal analysis of rank-abundance curves was rejected due to the inconsistency of the curve shapes among habitat types. Two other approaches were used and complemented each other: (ii) smoothed forest-type specific functions of total assemblage densities along post-clear-cut succession, and (iii) empirical average densities of each species by forest type and age class (for species composition analyses). The modelling revealed a parallel loss of bird densities and, to a lesser extent, of species at shorter rotations; currently, this effect is disproportionately large on productive soils. For conserving the productive hotspots, the 30% protection target of the EU Biodiversity Strategy overperformed other scenarios. In all landscape settings, typologically representative old-forest reserves (even artificially drained stands) helped to mitigate rotational forestry. The potential of even-aged production forestry to host early-successional species was already realized at much longer rotations than currently (given uniform stand-age structure). Comparing potential and realized bird assemblages provides a tool for assessing ecological integrity at the landscape scale, and the results can be used for elaborating regional management goals of ecologically sustainable forestry."

Thus, modeling and predicting androgen receptor activity is an important area of research. The aim of the current study was to find a method or combination of methods to predict compounds that can bind to and/or disrupt the androgen receptor, and thereby guide decision making and further analysis. A stepwise procedure proceeded from analysis of protein structures from human, chimp, and rat, followed by docking and subsequent ligand, and statistics based techniques that improved classification gradually. The best methods used multivariate logistic regression of combinations of chimpanzee protein structural docking scores, extended connectivity fingerprints, and naive Bayesians of known binders and non-binders. Combination or consensus methods included data from a variety of procedures to improve the final model accuracy."

Cities are becoming increasingly important points of contact between mosquitoes and their prey, as large-scale urbanization continues. Human settlements represent unique but fragmented habitats that are permanently warmer than rural areas. Because of this, there is a growing demand to better understand urban mosquito populations and the factors affecting them in various circumstances. The aim of this study was to investigate the weather conditions influencing mosquito species and abundance in a Northern European town. Thus, a three-year-long mosquito collection effort was undertaken in Estonia. Results indicated that the number of active mosquitoes decreased with wind and higher temperatures. Interestingly, there was a significant negative correlation between temperature and humidity. Furthermore, while mosquitoes belonging to theCulex pipiens/Culex torrentiumgroup were consistently abundant during the end of the warm season, other dominant species varied considerably between the months and the three study years. Overall, springtime hydrological conditions seemed to greatly influence the mosquito season. Urbanization could generate both higher temperatures and drier environments, resulting in fewer mosquitoes in some areas. This study also revealed the mosquito species most likely to contribute to disease transmission in Estonian towns."

Hence, we collected 24 commercial proteins from pea, oat, fava bean, chickpea, mung bean, potato, canola, soy, and wheat, including different batches, and assessed their techno-functional and sensory properties. Many powders had yellow, red, and brown color tones, but that of fava bean was the lightest. The native pH ranged from 6.0 to 7.7. The water solubility index was 28% on average, but after heat treatment the solubility typically increased. Soy isolate had by far the best water-holding capacity of 6.3 g (H2O) g√¢ÀÜ‚Äô1, and canola had the highest oil-holding capacity of 2.8 g (oil) g√¢ÀÜ‚Äô1. The foaming capacity and stability results were highly varied but typical to the raw material. The emulsification properties of all powders were similar. Upon heating, the highest viscosity and storage modulus were found in potato, canola, and mung bean. All powders had raw material flavor, were bitter and astringent, and undissolved particles were perceived in the mouth. Large differences in functionality were found between the batches of one pea powder. In conclusion, we emphasize the need for methodological standardization, but while respecting the conditions found in end applications like meat and dairy analogs."

This study seeks to characterize possible differences in microglia activation and overall severity of neuroinflammation in two widely used mouse strains, C57BL/6NTac (Bl6) and 129S6/SvEvTac (129Sv), in response to acute lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration. Locomotor activity within the open field arena revealed similar 24 h motor activity decline in both strains. Both strains also exhibited significant bodyweight loss due to LPS treatment, although it was more severe in the Bl6 strain. Furthermore, LPS induced a hypothermic response in Bl6 mice, which was not seen in 129Sv. We found that 24 h LPS challenge significantly increased the inflammatory status of microglia in 129Sv mice. On the other hand, we observed that, under physiological conditions, microglia of Bl6 seemed to be in a higher immune-alert state. Gene and protein expression analysis revealed that LPS induces a significantly stronger upregulation of MHC-I-pathway-related components in the brain of Bl6 compared to 129Sv mice. The most striking difference was detected in the olfactory bulb, where we observed significant LPS-induced upregulation of MHC-I pathway components in Bl6 mice, whereas no alterations were observed in 129Sv. We observed significant positive correlations between bodyweight decline and expressions of MHC-I components in the olfactory bulbs of Bl6 mice and the frontal cortex of 129Sv, highlighting different brain regions most affected by LPS in these strains. Our findings suggest that the brains of Bl6 mice exist in a more immunocompetent state compared to 129Sv mice."

Thereby, nutrient discharges to the marine environment should be reduced to a minimum. When fertilizers are loaded to the vessels in ports, a significant amount of nutrients are released into the sea, but so far these actions have received little attention. Here, we employed the Boosted Regression Trees modeling (BRT) to define the relationships between fertilizer loading, the loading area, rain intensity, nutrient discharge, and the marine environment, and then used the established relationships to predict the daily nutrient discharge due to fertilizer loading. The studied subject was a port in the Gulf of Finland, where significant amounts of both nitrogen and phosphorus are loaded to vessels. BRT models accounted for a significant proportion of the variability of nutrient discharge. As expected, the nutrient discharge increased with the number of fertilizers loaded and the intensity of rain. On the other hand, with the increasing loading area, the total nitrogen discharge increased, but the total phosphorus discharge decreased. The latter result may be due to the different characteristics of the loading areas of different terminals. The model predicted that at the studied port, the total nitrogen and phosphorus discharge to the marine environment due to fertilizer loading was 272,906 and 196 kg per year, respectively. Importantly, the developed model can be used to predict the nutrient loads for different future scenarios in order to propose the best mitigation methods for nutrient discharges to the sea."

Hemicellulose hydrothermal extractions were performed at different temperatures, times, and ratios of solid to liquid (S/L). Temperature and time showed a stronger effect on the solubilization of hemicellulose. Hemicellulose extraction at 155 √Ç¬∞C, 195 min, and an S/L ratio of 1/2 resulted in a hydrolysate with a xylose content of 37.0 g/l.R. toruloidescultivation in this hydrolysate showed that initial pH had a strong influence on cell growth. At an initial pH of 6.2, cells grew to 6.0 g/l of biomass with a lipid content of 50%.

The oleaginous yeastRhodotorula toruloidescan co-produce microbial oils and high-value compounds from low-cost substrates, such as xylose and acetic acid (from hemicellulosic hydrolysates) and raw glycerol (a byproduct of biodiesel production). One step towards economic viability is identifying the best conditions for lipid production, primarily the most suitable carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (C/N). Here, we aimed to identify the best conditions and cultivation mode for lipid production byR. toruloidesusing various low-cost substrates and a range of C/N ratios (60, 80, 100, and 120). Turbidostat mode was used to achieve a steady state at the maximal specific growth rate and to avoid continuously changing environmental conditions (i.e., C/N ratio) that inherently occur in batch mode. Regardless of the carbon source, higher C/N ratios increased lipid yields (up to 60% on xylose at a C/N of 120) but decreased the specific growth rate. Growth on glycerol resulted in the highest specific growth and lipid production (0.085√Ç¬†g lipids/gDW*h) rates at C/Ns between 60 and 100. We went on to study lipid production using glycerol in both batch and fed-batch modes, which resulted in lower specific lipid production rates compared with turbisdostat, however, fed batch is superior in terms of biomass production and lipid titers. By combining the data we obtained in these experiments with a genome-scale metabolic model ofR. toruloides, we identified targets for improvements in lipid production that could be carried out either by metabolic engineering or process optimization."

Virtual reality (VR) could represent a tool for the early assessment of this pathological condition and for administering cognitive training. This work presents a study evaluating the acceptance and the user experience of an immersive VR application representing a supermarket. As the same application had already been assessed in Italy, we aimed to perform the same study in Estonia in order to compare the outcomes in the two populations. Fifteen older adults with MCI were enrolled in one Rehabilitation Center of Estonia and tried the supermarket once. Afterwards, they were administered questionnaires aimed at evaluating their technology acceptance, sense of presence, and cybersickness. Estonian participants reported low side effects and discrete enjoyment, and a sense of presence. Nonetheless, their intention to use the technology decreased after the experience. The comparison between Italian and Estonian older adults showed that cybersickness was comparable, but technology acceptance and sense of presence were significantly lower in the Estonian group. Thus, we argue that: (i) cultural and social backgrounds influence technology acceptance; (ii) technology acceptance was rather mediated by the absence of positive feelings rather than cybersickness."

Moreover, the mitochondrial functional versatility enables cells to adapt to the changes in cellular environment and various stresses. In the process of discharging its cellular duties, mitochondria face multiple types of challenges, such as oxidative stress, protein-related challenges (import, folding, and degradation) and mitochondrial DNA damage. They mitigate all these challenges with robust quality control mechanisms which include antioxidant defenses, proteostasis systems (chaperones and proteases) and mitochondrial biogenesis. Failure of these quality control mechanisms leaves mitochondria as terminally damaged, which then have to be promptly cleared from the cells before they become a threat to cell survival. Such damaged mitochondria are degraded by a selective form of autophagy called mitophagy. Rigorous research in the field has identified multiple types of mitophagy processes based on targeting signals on damaged or superfluous mitochondria. In this review, we provide an in-depth overview of mammalian mitophagy and its importance in human health and diseases. We also attempted to highlight the future area of investigation in the field of mitophagy."

Modern pollen analyses from surface sediment samples of 36 waterbodies from Latvia alongside oceanic-continental, lowland-upland, urban-rural and forested-agricultural gradients have been studied. In addition, we considered the dominant Quaternary sediment, soil type and land use around the studied waterbodies in buffer zones with widths of one and four km. The information on climate for the last 30 years from the closest meteorological station for each study site was obtained. Data were analyzed using Pearson correlation and principal component analysis. Results show that relative pollen values from surface sediment of waterbodies reflect dominant vegetation type and land use. Modern forest biomass had a positive correlation with pollen accumulation rate, indicating the potential use of pollen-based forest biomass reconstructions for the boreonemoral zone after additional research and calibration."

Therefore, we attempted to extend the shelf-life of ready-to-eat pomegranate arils using active MAP at an ambient temperature and evaluated its chemical, quality, and microbial properties. Samples were flushed with specific gas compositions of oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) at an ambient temperature and 60 √Ç¬± 2% relative humidity (RH). The findings demonstrated that active MAP increased the titratable acidity (0.32&3.64%), anthocyanins (0.27&0.42 g/L), reducing sugars (1.06&10.13%), and total soluble solids (15&19 √Ç¬∞Brix), while it decreased the pH (3.20&3.54) and hardness (4.60&9.40 N) with a microbial load of √¢‚Ä∞¬§5 log CFU/g at ambient temperature for 5 days. Ultimately, active MAP could be an effective technique to be used in ready-to-eat produce industries and has the potential to guarantee a longer shelf-life at ambient temperature without the use of refrigerator facilities."

This paper focuses on the hardware implementation of a research laboratory setup and the precise vector control of the SynRM in real-time. The application of the digital controller and inverter to drive SynRM is examined. The voltage, current, and speed transducers were employed for monitoring the protective measures and to control the motor in the closed-loop. The design of the signal conditioning and the intermediary cards for isolation and data acquisition are described in detail. An algorithm is proposed to measure the whole system parameters, including motor, inverter, and cables. Thanks to the RT box 1, the principle of real-time simulation of control algorithms is investigated, and the rapid control prototyping of field-oriented control (FOC) of SynRM was implemented. The simulation of the system was carried out in the Plecs platform, and the results are presented. The experimental results of the implemented control algorithms validate the setup's performance and the control algorithm. Finally, as a study of the motor's performance, the efficiency map of the motor is drawn in different speed and torque ranges."

The Sentinel-3 Ku/C Radar Altimeter (SRAL) is one of the synthetic aperture radar altimeters (SAR Altimeter) which is more precise for coastal and lake observations. The article studies the performance of the Sentinel-3 Level-2 sea level altimetry products in the coastal areas of the Baltic Sea and on two lakes of Estonia. The Sentinel-3 data were compared with (i) collocated Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) ship measurements, (ii) the Estonian geoid model (EST-GEOID2017) together with sea-level anomaly corrections from the tide gauges, and (iii) collocated buoy measurements. The comparisons were carried out along seven Sentinel-3A/B tracks across the Baltic Sea and Estonian lakes in 2019. In addition, the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) Level-3 sea-level products and the Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean (NEMO) reanalysis outcomes were compared with measurements from Estonia's 21 tide gauges and the buoy deployed offshore. Our results showed that the uncertainty of the Sentinel-3 Level-2 altimetry product was below decimetre level for the seacoast and the selected lakes of Estonia. Results from CMEMS Level-3 altimetry products showed a correlation of 0.83 (RMSE 0.18 m) and 0.91 (RMSE 0.27 m) when compared against the tide gauge measurements and the NEMO model, respectively. The overall performance of the altimetry products was very good, except in the immediate vicinity of the coastline and for the lakes, where the accuracy was nearly three times lower than for the open sea, but still acceptably good."

Furthermore, there is a lack of systematization in model evaluation in MMLA, which is also reflected in the heterogeneous reporting of the evaluation results. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes an evaluation framework to assess and report the generalizability of ML models in MMLA (EFAR-MMLA). To illustrate the usefulness of EFAR-MMLA, we present a case study with two datasets, each with audio and log data collected from a classroom during a collaborative learning session. In this case study, regression models are developed for collaboration quality and its sub-dimensions, and their generalizability is evaluated and reported. The framework helped us to systematically detect and report that the models achieved better performance when evaluated using hold-out or cross-validation but quickly degraded when evaluated across different student groups and learning contexts. The framework helps to open up a √¢‚Ç¨≈ìwicked problem√¢‚Ç¨¬ù in MMLA research that remains fuzzy (i.e., the generalizability of ML models), which is critical to both accumulating knowledge in the research community and demonstrating the practical relevance of these techniques."

Proteasome is a key player in multiple myeloma and proteasome inhibitors are the current first-line of treatment. However, these are associated with limited clinical efficacy due to acquired resistance. One of the solutions to overcome this problem is a polypharmacology approach, namely combination therapy and multitargeting drugs. Several polypharmacology avenues are currently being explored. The simultaneous inhibition of EZH2 and Proteasome 20S remains to be investigated, despite the encouraging evidence of therapeutic synergy between the two. Therefore, we sought to bridge this gap by proposing a holistic in silico strategy to find new dual-target inhibitors. First, we assessed the characteristics of both pockets and compared the chemical space of EZH2 and Proteasome 20S inhibitors, to establish the feasibility of dual targeting. This was followed by molecular docking calculations performed on EZH2 and Proteasome 20S inhibitors from ChEMBL 25, from which we derived a predictive model to propose new EZH2 inhibitors among Proteasome 20S compounds, and vice versa, which yielded two dual-inhibitor hits. Complementarily, we built a machine learning QSAR model for each target but realised their application to our data is very limited as each dataset occupies a different region of chemical space. We finally proceeded with molecular dynamics simulations of the two docking hits against the two targets. Overall, we concluded that one of the hit compounds is particularly promising as a dual-inhibitor candidate exhibiting extensive hydrogen bonding with both targets. Furthermore, this work serves as a framework for how to rationally approach a dual-targeting drug discovery project, from the selection of the targets to the prediction of new hit compounds."

These scaffolds usually comprise randomly oriented fibers. Much less common are nanofibrous scaffolds made of stiff inorganic materials such as alumina. Well-aligned matrices are a promising tool for evaluation of behavior of biological objects affected by micro/nano-topologies as well as anisotropy. In this work, for the first time, we report a joint analysis of biomechanical properties of new ultra-anisotropic, self-aligned ceramic nanofibers augmented with two modifications of graphene shells (GAIN scaffolds) and their interaction of three different viral types (influenza virus A, picornavirus (human parechovirus) and potato virus). It was discovered that nano-topology and structure of the graphene layers have a significant implication on mechanical properties of GAIN scaffolds resulting in non-linear behavior. It was demonstrated that the viral adhesion to GAIN scaffolds is likely to be guided by physical cues in dependence on mutual steric factors, as the scaffolds lack common cell membrane proteins and receptors which viruses usually deploy for transfection. The study may have implications for selective viral adsorption, infected cells analysis, and potentially opening new tools for anti-viral drugs development."

Kazakhstan is an example of how languages (official Kazakh, the language of communication Russian and international English) coexist peacefully. Language policy and planning depend on the ability and willingness of individual members of the speech community to adopt a language. Language planning is often seen as a top-down, government-controlled activity. This paper shows that language planning can also be carried out from below. Here, we analyze the main initiatives of grassroots movements in promoting the status of the Kazakh language and the emergence of new bottom-up approaches facilitated by the Internet and present sociolinguistic survey results regarding the roles, importance and prestige of languages for the people of Kazakhstan. The focus of the study reported in this article is to monitor the transformative character of bottom-up approaches to language-policy study in Kazakhstan."

In this contribution we propose a spatial cost-benefit optimization framework that prioritizes how to spatially apply limited cleanup efforts within a spatial network of marine litter sources. The aim of this framework is to maximize the environmental benefit from cleanup efforts, using input from the maturing field of marine litter transport modeling, in combination with ecosystem functioning and ecosystem service provisions, in relation to variable litter concentrations, as wells as the possibly non-linear cost-efficiency of the clean-up technologies. Following the finding ofSherman and van Sebille (2016), emphasis is placed on the application of cleanup measures near source points. The advantage of our framework is that it improves our understanding of how the optimal solution emerges from the trade-off between ecology and economics, as mediated by physics. Our approach is targeted at the regional marine scale where it is more realistic to arrive at a science-based decision. Here the time scale between investment and benefit is expected to be shorter than at the global scale, because transport pathways are shorter."

NTFs injected into the brain rescue and regenerate certain neuronal populations lost in neurodegenerative diseases, demonstrating the potential of NTFs to cure the diseases rather than simply alleviating the symptoms. NTFs (as the vast majority of molecules) do not pass through the blood&brain barrier (BBB) and therefore, are delivered directly into the brain of patients using costly and risky intracranial surgery. The delivery efficacy and poor diffusion of some NTFs inside the brain are considered the major problems behind their modest effects in clinical trials. Thus, there is a great need for NTFs to be delivered systemically thereby avoiding intracranial surgery. Nanoparticles (NPs), particles with the size dimensions of 1-100 nm, can be used to stabilize NTFs and facilitate their transport through the BBB. Several studies have shown that NTFs can be loaded into or attached onto NPs, administered systemically and transported to the brain. To improve the NP-mediated NTF delivery through the BBB, the surface of NPs can be functionalized with specific ligands such as transferrin, insulin, lactoferrin, apolipoproteins, antibodies or short peptides that will be recognized and internalized by the respective receptors on brain endothelial cells. In this review, we elaborate on the most suitable NTF delivery methods and envision √¢‚Ç¨≈ìideal√¢‚Ç¨¬ù NTF for Parkinson's disease (PD) and clinical trial thereof. We shortly summarize clinical trials of four NTFs, glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), neurturin (NRTN), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-BB), and cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor (CDNF), that were tested in PD patients, focusing mainly on GDNF and CDNF. We summarize current possibilities of NP-mediated delivery of NTFs to the brain and discuss whether NPs have impact in improving the properties of NTFs and delivery across the BBB. Emerging delivery approaches and future directions of NTF-based nanomedicine are also discussed."

The two-step approach aims to avoid the uncontrolled degradation of hemicellulose during pretreatment and to recover high sugar yields from hemicellulose and cellulose. Additionally, the pretreated biomass was filtered after each pretreatment step with a fine metal sieve so that fermentation and hydrolysis inhibitors were removed. A total sugar yield of 43 g per 100 g of dry biomass was achieved from barley straw and aspen wood. For pine wood, the total sugar yield was significantly lower, with 12 g per 100 g of dry biomass. Possible reasons for this low sugar yield are the adsorption and deactivation of cellulases on softwood hemicellulose and on repolymerized lignin after pretreatment."

In this technique, the load disaggregation for the individual device is accrued by the recognition of their current signals by employing machine learning (ML) methods. This research paper conducts a comprehensive comparative analysis of various ML techniques applied to NILM, aiming to identify the most effective methodologies for accurate load disaggregation. The study employs a diverse dataset comprising high-resolution electricity consumption data collected from an Estonian household. The ML algorithms, including deep neural networks based on long short-term memory networks (LSTM), extreme gradient boost (XgBoost), logistic regression (LR), and dynamic time warping with K-nearest neighbor (DTW-KNN) are implemented and evaluated for their performance in load disaggregation. Key evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are utilized to assess the effectiveness of each technique in capturing the nuanced energy consumption patterns of diverse appliances. Results indicate that the XgBoost-based model demonstrates superior performance in accurately identifying and disaggregating individual loads from aggregated energy consumption data. Insights derived from this research contribute to the optimization of NILM techniques for real-world applications, facilitating enhanced energy efficiency and informed decision-making in smart grid environments."

Therefore, this research developed nutri-rich instant noodles by using foxtail millet (FTM) (Setaria italic) flour to improve the contents of protein and nutrients and increase its commercial importance. FTM flour was mixed with wheat flour (Triticum aestivum) at a ratio of 0:100, 30:60, 40:50, and 50:40, and the samples were named as control, FTM30, FTM40, and FTM50 noodles, respectively. Mushroom (Pleurotus ostreatus) and rice bran (Oryza sativaL.) flour were added at a percentage of 5% to all the composite noodles (FTM30, FTM40, and FTM50 noodles). The contents of biochemicals, minerals, and amino acids, as well as the organoleptic properties of the noodles, were examined and compared with wheat flour as a control. The results revealed that the carbohydrate (CHO) content of FTM50 noodles was significantly lower (p< 0.05) than all the developed and five commercial noodles named A-1, A-2, A-3, A-4, and A-5. Moreover, the FTM noodles had significantly higher levels of protein, fiber, ash, calcium, and phosphorous than the control and commercial noodles. The percentage of lysine calculated protein efficiency ratio (PER), essential amino acid index (EAAI), biological value (BV), and chemical score (CS) of FTM50 noodles were also higher than that of the commercial noodles. The total bacterial count was nil for the FTM50 noodles, and the organoleptic properties were consistent with those of acceptable standards. The results could encourage the application of FTM flours for the development of variety and value-added noodles with enhanced level of nutrients."

The challenge is how to efficiently utilize their energy production. This includes decreasing the share and costs of external energy: usually electrical energy delivered from the grid. The following study presents a qualitative approach with a combined control to solve the problem. The approach is demonstrated using a simulated residential building equipped with a hybrid energy system: a thermal energy storage combined with an electrical heater, a geothermal heat pump and a solar thermal collector. Consequently, the share of renewable energy was increased and, conversely, costs of the external energy from grid decreased by 12.2%. The results were based on a qualitative approach and the algorithm which predicts the need of energy of the building over the next 6 h with the aid of weather forecasting. This approach included a storage tank of 300 L. The energy costs can be further decreased 7.7% by increasing thermal storage capacity and modifying the control algorithm. In all cases, the indoor conditions were kept at a comfortable level. However, if the room temperature is temporarily allowed to slightly drop a few degrees during the heating season, the energy costs were further reduced."

Most applications of cellulose electroactive materials are developed for energy storage and sensors, while only a few are reported for linear actuators. Therefore, we introduce here cellulose-multiwall carbon nanotube composite (Cell-CNT) fibers compared with pristine multiwall carbon nanotube (CNT) fibers made by dielectrophoresis (DEP) in their linear actuation in an organic electrolyte. Electrochemical measurements (cyclic voltammetry, square wave potential steps, and chronopotentiometry) were performed with electromechanical deformation (EMD) measurements. The linear actuation of Cell-CNT outperformed the main actuation at discharging, having 7.9 kPa stress and 0.062% strain, making this composite more sustainable in smart materials, textiles, or robotics. The CNT fiber depends on scan rates switching from mixed actuation to main expansion at negative charging. The CNT fiber-specific capacitance was much enhanced with 278 F g√¢ÀÜ‚Äô1, and had a capacity retention of 96% after 5000 cycles, making this fiber more sustainable in energy storage than the Cell-CNT fiber.

With the data collected from 13,009 participants across fifty countries, we compare associations of four types of happiness (out of which three are more collectivism-themed than personal life satisfaction) with two different measures of individualism. We replicated previous findings by demonstrating that societal happiness measured as country-level aggregate of personal life satisfaction is correlated with individualism. Importantly though, we also found that the country-level aggregates of the collectivism-themed measures of happiness do not tend to be significantly correlated with individualism. Implications for happiness studies and for policy makers are signaled."

Monitoring nutrient loads is especially important for the Baltic Sea, which is especially sensitive to the eutrophication. Using optical remote sensing data in mapping total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) is challenging because these substances do not have a direct influence on the water optics that remote sensing sensors can detect. On the other hand, it would be very rewarding. In this study, more than 25,000 Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) data algorithms were tested in order to detect the TN and TP concentrations in the Estonian marine waters between 2016&2021. The TN estimations were well derived for Estonian marine waters (R2= 0.73, RMSE = 4.87 √Ç¬µmolN L√¢ÀÜ‚Äô1, MAPE = 14%,n= 708), while the TP estimations were weaker (R2= 0.38, RMSE = 0.23 √Ç¬µmolP L√¢ÀÜ‚Äô1, MAPE = 24%,n= 730). The Estonian marine waters were divided into six geographic regions in order to study the effect of regional water quality on the TN and TP retrievals. The nutrient concentrations were derived in every region when spring and summer periods were treated separately. In this study, the detection of both nutrients was more successful in more closed areas with P deficiency, while in open sea areas it was more challenging. This study shows that it is possible to estimate nutrients, especially TN, from remote sensing data. Consequently, remote sensing could provide a reliable support to the conventional monitoring by covering large marine areas with high temporal and spatial resolution data."

Method: An experiment was conducted in Estonia, with two groups: those who spoke Estonian as their first language and those who spoke Russian as their first language and Estonian as their second. Both groups listened to Estonian-language radio advertisements presented by various spokespeople, half of which were performed in a calm style (low arousal) and half in an energetic style (high arousal). They then rated the likability of each performance.

Results: The results showed that both groups preferred the calm style but there were significant differences in the scores: the first group gave the calm style significantly higher scores than the second group, while the latter scored the energetic style more highly.

 Knowing the advertising style preferences in a society where people have different first languages may allow for better targeting of advertising."

Using fuzzy real options models as the conceptual framework, together with secondary data analysis, case studies and expert interviews, the authors chart possible courses for the construction of ammonia production facilities within the region. Based on the case of the NH3production plant, as well as the underlying distribution system, the study provides new economic perspectives for lower carbonization for the shipping industry, an attempt at creating a model for other European regions toward climate change mitigation."

Often, contradictory results arise from examining different sources of measurement and time spans. This study addresses these issues by analysing both long-term (1995&2022) and decadal (2000&2009 and 2010&2019) sea-level trends in the Baltic Sea. Two independent sources of data, which consist of 13 tide gauge (TG) stations and multi-mission along-track satellite altimetry (SA), are utilized to calculate sea-level trends using the ordinary least-squares method. Given that the Baltic Sea is influenced by geographically varying vertical land motion (VLM), both relative sea level (RSL) and absolute sea level (ASL) trends were examined for the long-term assessment. The results for the long-term ASL show estimates for TG and SA to be 3.3 mm/yr and 3.9 mm/yr, respectively, indicating agreement between sources. Additionally, the comparison of long-term RSL ranges from √¢ÀÜ‚Äô2 to 4.5 mm/yr, while ASL varies between 2 and 5.4 mm/yr, as expected due to the VLM. Spatial variation in long-term ASL trends is observed, with higher rates in the northern and eastern regions. Decadal sea-level trends show higher rates, particularly the decade 2000&2009. Comparison with other available sea-level datasets (gridded models) yields comparable results. Therefore, this study evaluates the ability of SA as a reliable source for determining reginal sea-level trends in comparison with TG data."

The aim of this work was to develop an optical method to estimate the removal of √é¬≤2-microglobulin (√é¬≤2M), a marker of middle molecule (MM) uremic toxins, during hemodialysis (HD) treatment. Ultraviolet (UV) and fluorescence spectra of dialysate samples were recorded from 88 dialysis sessions of 22 ESKD patients, receiving four different settings of dialysis treatments. Stepwise regression was used to obtain the best model for the assessment of √é¬≤2M concentration in the spent dialysate. The correlation coefficient 0.958 and an accuracy of 0.000 √Ç¬± 0.304 mg/L was achieved between laboratory and optically estimated √é¬≤2M concentrations in spent dialysate for the entire cohort. Optically and laboratory estimated reduction ratio (RR) and total removed solute (TRS) of √é¬≤2M were not statistically different (p> 0.35). Dialytic elimination of MM uremic toxin √é¬≤2M can be followed optically during dialysis treatment of ESKD patients. The main contributors to the optical signal of the MM fraction in the spent dialysate were provisionally identified as tryptophan (Trp) in small peptides and proteins, and advanced glycation end-products."

Intramolecular acylation yielding macrocyclic lactones can also be performed. The developed transformation has bolstered the synthetic utility of cyclopropanols as pluripotent intermediates in diversity-oriented synthesis of bioactive natural products and their synthetic congeners. For example, it was successfully applied for the last-stage modification of a cyclic peptide to produce a precursor of a known histone deacetylase inhibitor."

It allows resolution and quantification of NMR signals of certain classes of low-abundance metabolites that would otherwise be undetectable. Applications have been implemented in pharmacokinetics and doping drug detection, demonstrating the versatility of the technique. Yet, in order for the method to be adopted by the analytical community, certain limitations have to be understood and overcome. One such question is NMR signal assignment. At present, the only reliable way to establish the identity of an analyte that gives rise to certain parahydrogen hyperpolarized NMR signals is internal standard addition, which can be laborious. Herein we show that analogously to regular NMR metabolomics, generating libraries of hyperpolarized analyte signals is a viable way to address this limitation. We present hyperpolarized spectral data of adenosines and give an early example of identifying them from a urine sample with the small library. Doing so, we verify the detectability of a class of diagnostically valuable metabolites: adenosine and its derivatives, some of which are cancer biomarkers, and some are central to cellular energy management (e.g., ATP)."

Despite the low speeds involved, parking manoeuvres are among the main causes of minor and sometimes major traffic accidents, especially in urban areas where limited parking spaces are available. Furthermore, searching for a parking space wastes time and contributes to unnecessary road occupancy and pollution. This paper is dedicated to the development of an autonomous parking system for on-street parking in urban areas. The system is capable of fully automated parking manoeuvres from drop-off to pick-up zones, thus removing human drivers from the vehicle control loop. The system autonomously navigates to the parking space and parks the vehicle without human intervention. The proposed system incorporates a communication protocol that connects automated vehicles, parking infrastructure, and drivers. Several convenient human&machine interface concepts for efficient system communication and state monitoring have been developed. A methodology for validating the system in real time is proposed, which includes functionality requirements and a description of parallel and perpendicular parking manoeuvres. The proposed pipeline is tested on an electric vehicle platform with automated functions, where successful technological functionality is demonstrated."

Non-motor symptoms are also well-recognised in this disorder, and peripheral neuropathy is a frequent but poorly appreciated non-motor sign. Studying how central and peripheral sensory systems are affected can contribute to the development of targeted therapies and deepen our understanding of the pathophysiology of PD. Although the cause of sporadic PD is unknown, chronic exposure to the pesticide rotenone in humans increases the risk of developing the disease. Here, we aimed to investigate whether peripheral neuropathy is present in a traditional model of PD. Mice receiving intrastriatal rotenone showed greatly reduced dopamine terminals in the striatum and a reduction in tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons in theSubstantia nigra pars compactaand developed progressive motor impairments in hindlimb stepping and rotarod but no change in spontaneous activity. Interestingly, repeated testing using gold-standard protocols showed no change in gut motility, a well-known non-motor symptom of PD. Importantly, we did not observe any change in heat, cold, or touch sensitivity, again based upon repeated testing with well-validated protocols that were statistically well powered. Therefore, this traditional model fails to replicate PD, and our data again reiterate the importance of the periphery to the disorder."

In the present study, underwater ambient sound recordings from two monitoring locations in marine-protected areas (MPAs) of the Gulf of Riga were analysed. Both locations belong to the natural habitat of pinnipeds whose vocalisations were detected and analysed. An increase of vocal activity during the mating period in the late winter was revealed, including percussive signallings of grey seals. The ambient sound spectra showed that in the current shallow sea conditions ship traffic noise contributed more in the higher frequency bands. Thus, a 500 Hz one-third octave band was chosen as an indicator frequency band for anthropogenic noise in the monitoring area. It was shown that changes in the soundscape occurring during the freezing period create favourable conditions for ship noise propagation at larger distances. Based on the monitoring data, the environmental risks related to the anthropogenic sound around the monitoring sites were considered as low. However, further analysis showed that for a small percentage of time the ship traffic can cause auditory masking for the ringed seals."

The ingredients strongly influenced the process conditions and the use of PDFrequired higher specific mechanical energy and screw speed to create fibrous texture compared to PIsand SIs. PDFcan be conveniently used to produce meat analogues with a protein content of 55 g 100 g√¢ÀÜ‚Äô1, which is exploitable in meat-alternatives formulation. PDF-based meat analogues showed lower hardness (13.55&18.33 N) than those produced from PIsand SIs(nearly 27 N), probably due to a more porous structure given by the natural presence of carbohydrates in the dry-fractionated ingredient. PDF_OPand PIs_PDF_OPshowed a significantly lower water absorption capacity than PIsOPand SIs_OP, whereas pea-based extrudates showed high oil absorption capacity, which could be convenient to facilitate the inclusion of oil and fat in the final formulation. The sensory evaluation highlighted an intense odor and taste profile of PDF_OP, whereas the extrudates produced by protein isolates had more neutral sensory characteristics. Overall, the use of dry-fractionated protein supports the strategies to efficiently produce clean-labeled and sustainable plant-based meat analogues."

This study aimed to evaluate the capacity of four treatment wetland macrophytes,Phalaris arundinacea,Typha angustifolia, and two subspecies ofPhragmites australis, to tolerate and treat leachates containing wood preservatives. The experiment was conducted using 96 plant pots in 12 tanks filled with three leachate concentrations compared to uncontaminated water. Biomass production and bioaccumulation were measured after 35 and 70 days of exposure. There were no significant effects of leachate contamination concentration on plant biomass for any species. No contaminants were detected in aboveground parts of the macrophytes, precluding their use for phytoextraction within the tested contamination levels. However, all species accumulated As and chlorinated phenols in belowground parts, and this accumulation was more prevalent under a more concentrated leachate. Up to 0.5 mg pentachlorophenol/kg (from 81 √Ç¬µg/L in the leachate) and 50 mg As/kg (from 330 √Ç¬µg/L in the leachate) were accumulated in the belowground biomass. Given their high productivity and tolerance to the contaminants, the tested macrophytes showed phytostabilization potential and could enhance the degradation of phenols from leachates contaminated with wood preservatives in treatment wetlands."

In this review article, the diverse aspects of the anticancer potential of phloretin are addressed, presenting its antiproliferative, proapoptotic, antimetastatic, and antiangiogenic activities in many different preclinical cancer models. The fact that phloretin is a planar lipophilic polyphenol and, thus, a membrane-disrupting Pan-Assay Interference compound (PAIN) compromises the validity of the cell-based anticancer activities. Phloretin significantly reduces membrane dipole potential and, therefore, is expected to be able to activate a number of cellular signaling pathways in a non-specific way. In this way, the effects of this minor flavonoid on Bax and Bcl-2 proteins, caspases and MMPs, cytokines, and inflammatory enzymes are all analyzed in the current review. Moreover, besides the anticancer activities exerted by phloretin alone, its co-effects with conventional anticancer drugs are also under discussion. Therefore, this review presents a thorough overview of the preclinical anticancer potential of phloretin, allowing one to take the next steps in the development of novel drug candidates and move on to clinical trials."

P content in soils can vary largely, but usually, only a small fraction is plant-available or in an organic form for biological utilization because it is bound in incompletely weathered mineral particles or adsorbed on mineral surfaces. Furthermore, in agricultural ecosystems, plant-available P content in topsoil is mainly controlled by fertilization and land management. To understand, model, and predict P dynamics at the landscape level, the availability of detailed observation-based P data is extremely valuable. We used more than 388,000 topsoil plant-available P samples from the period 2005 to 2021 to study spatial and temporal variability and land-use effect on soil P. We developed a mapping approach based on existing databases of soil, land-use, and fragmentary soil P measurements by land-use classes to provide spatially explicit high-resolution estimates of topsoil P at the national level. The modeled spatially detailed (1:10,000 scale) GIS dataset of topsoil P is useful for precision farming to optimize nutrient application and to increase productivity; it can also be used as input for biogeochemical models and to assess P load in inland waters and sea."

Cyanobacteria utilize the orange carotenoid protein (OCP) as a high-light sensor and quencher to regulate the energy flow in the photosynthetic apparatus. Triggered by strong light, OCP undergoes conformational changes to form the active red state (OCPR). In many cyanobacteria, the back conversion of OCP to the dark-adapted state is assisted by the fluorescence recovery protein (FRP). However, the exact molecular events involving OCP and its interaction with FRP remain largely unraveled so far due to their metastability. Here, we use small-angle neutron scattering combined with size exclusion chromatography (SEC-SANS) to unravel the solution structures of FRP-OCP complexes using a compact mutant of OCP lacking the N-terminal extension (√¢ÀÜ‚Ä†NTEOCPO) and wild-type FRP. The results are consistent with the simultaneous presence of stable 2:2 and 2:1 FRP-√¢ÀÜ‚Ä†NTEOCPOcomplexes in solution, where the former complex type is observed for the first time. For both complex types, we provide ab initio low-resolution shape reconstructions and compare them to homology models based on available crystal structures. It is likely that both complexes represent intermediate states of the back conversion of OCP to its dark-adapted state in the presence of FRP, which are of transient nature in the photocycle of wild-type OCP. This study demonstrates the large potential of SEC-SANS in revealing the solution structures of protein complexes in polydisperse solutions that would otherwise be averaged, leading to unspecific results."

However, monitoring the PP in lakes with traditional complicated and costly in situ sampling methods are impossible due to the large number of lakes worldwide (estimated to be 117 million lakes). In this study, bio-optical modelling and remote sensing data (Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument) was combined to investigate the spatial and temporal variation of PP in four Baltic lakes during 2018. The model used has three input parameters: concentration of chlorophyll-a, the diffuse attenuation coefficient, and incident downwelling irradiance. The largest of our studied lakes, V√µrtsj‰rv (270 km2), had the highest total yearly estimated production (61 Gg C y√¢ÀÜ‚Äô1) compared to the smaller lakes Lubans (18 Gg C y√¢ÀÜ‚Äô1) and Razna (7 Gg C y√¢ÀÜ‚Äô1).

Even if lake size plays a significant role in the total PP of the lake, the abundance of small and medium-sized lakes would sum up to a significant contribution of carbon fixation.

Coordination of its transcriptome to satisfy all the maternal-fetal needs across gestation is not fully understood. MicroRNAs are powerful transcriptome modulators capable to adjust rapidly the expression level and dynamics of large gene sets. This MiR-Seq based study presents a multi-omics investigation of the human placental miRNome and its synergy with the transcriptome. The analysis included 52 placentas representing three trimesters of normal pregnancy, and term cases of late-onset preeclampsia (LO-PE), gestational diabetes and affected fetal growth. Gestational-age dependent differential expression (FDR < 0.05) was detected for 319 of 417 tested miRNAs (76.5%). A shared list of target genes of dynamic miRNAs suggested their coordinated action. The most abundant miR-143-3p revealed as a marker for pregnancy progression. The data suggested critical, but distinct roles of placenta-specific imprinted C19MC and C14MC miRNA clusters. Paternally encoded primate-specific C19MC was highly transcribed during first trimester, potentially fine-tuning the early placental transcriptome in dosage-sensitive manner. Maternally encoded eutherian C14MC showed high expression until term, underlining its key contribution across gestation. A major shift in placental miRNome (16% miRNAs) was observed in LO-PE, but not in other term pregnancy complications. Notably, 13/38 upregulated miRNAs were transcribed from C19MC and only one from C14MC, whereas 11/28 downregulated miRNAs represented C14MC and none C19MC. miR-210-3p, miR-512-5p, miR-32-5p, miR-19a-3p, miR-590-3p, miR-379-5p were differentially expressed in LO-PE and cases of small-for-gestational-age newborns, supporting a shared etiology. Expression correlation analysis with the RNA-Seq data (16,567 genes) of the same samples clustered PE-linked miRNAs into five groups. Large notable clusters of miRNA&gene pairs showing directly and inversely correlated expression dynamics suggested potential functional relationships in both scenarios. The first genome-wide study of placental miR-eQTLs identified 66 placental SNVs associated with the expression of neighboring miRNAs, including PE-linked miRNAs miR-30a-5p, miR-210-3p, miR-490-3p and miR-518-5p. This study provided a rich catalog of miRNAs for further in-depth investigations of their individual and joint effect on placental transcriptome.

ThePlectranthusgenus has a vast variety of species that has allowed the isolation of cytotoxic compounds with notable activities. The abietane diterpenes 6,7-dehydroroyleanone (DeRoy,1), 7√é¬±-acetoxy-6√é¬≤-hydroxyroyleanone (Roy,2), and Parvifloron D (ParvD,3) were obtained fromPlectranthusspp. and showed promising biological activities, such as cytotoxicity. The inhibitory effects of the different natural abietanes (1-3) were compared in MFC7, SkBr3, and SUM159 cell lines, as well as SUM159 grown in cancer stem cell-inducing conditions. Based on the royleanones' bioactivity, the derivatives RoyBz (4), RoyBzCl (5), RoyPr2(6), and DihydroxyRoy (7), previously obtained from2, were selected for further studies. Protein kinases C (PKCs) are involved in several carcinogenic processes. Thus, PKCs are potential targets for cancer therapy. To date, the portfolio of available PKC modulators remains very limited due to the difficulty of designing isozyme-selective PKC modulators. As such, molecular docking was used to evaluate royleanones1-6as predicted isozyme-selective PKC binders. Subtle changes in the binding site of each PKC isoform change the predicted interaction profiles of the ligands. Subtle changes in royleanone substitution patterns, such as a double substitution only with non-substituted phenyls, or hydroxybenzoate at position four that flips the binding mode of ParvD (3), can increase the predicted interactions in certain PKC subtypes."

They can produce calcite, aragonite, and amorphous phosphates. Serpulids possess very diverse tube ultra-structures, several unique to them. Serpulid tubes are composed of aragonite or calcite or a mixture of both polymorphs. The serpulid tubes with complex oriented microstructures, such as lamello fibrillar, are exclusively calcitic, whereas tubes with prismatic structures can be composed either of calcite or aragonite. In serpulids, the calcareous opercula also have complex microstructures. Evolutionarily, calcitic serpulid taxa belong to one clade and the aragonitic taxa belong to another clade. Modern ocean acidification affects serpulid biomineralization. Serpulids are capable of biomineralization in extreme environments, such as the deepest part (hadal zone) of the ocean. The tubes of calcareous sabellids are aragonitic and have two layers, the inner irregular spherulitic prismatic layer and the outer spherulitic layer. The tube wall of cirratulids is composed of aragonitic lamellae with a spherulitic prismatic structure. In some other polychaetes, biominerals are formed in different parts of the animal body, such as chaetae or body shields, or occur within the body as granule-shaped or rod-shaped inclusions."

As the properties and behavior of PPy depends strongly on the operating environment: electrolyte, solvent, etc., it is desirable to plant immobile ionic species into PPy films to ensure stable response. A premade ionic polymer is not optimal in many cases, as it enforces its own structure on the conducting polymer, therefore, polymerization during fabrication is preferred. Pyrrole (Py) was electropolymerized at low temperature together with a polymerizable ionic liquid (PIL) monomer in a one-step polymerization, to form a stable film on the working electrode. The structure and morphology of the PPyPIL films were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and solid-state NMR (ssNMR) spectroscopy. The spectroscopy results confirmed the successful polymerization of Py to PPy and PIL monomer to PIL. The presence of (TFSI&) anions that balance the charge in PPyPIL was confirmed by EDX analysis. The electrical properties of PPyPIL in lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)-imide (LiTFSI) aqueous and propylene carbonate solutions were examined with cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronoamperometry, and chronopotentiometry. The blend of PPyPIL had mixed electronic/ionic conductive properties that were strongly influenced by the solvent. In aqueous electrolyte, the electrical conductivity was 30 times lower and the diffusion coefficient 1.5 times higher than in the organic electrolyte. Importantly, the capacity, current density, and charge density were found to stay consistent, independent of the choice of solvent."

At the same time, available experimental evidence is limited for testing gravity as a force beyond the regimes in which the theory of general relativity has proven to be successful. This situation leads researchers to look for ‚Äúthe simplest modification‚Äù to general relativity in a certain class of models, which is enough to solve one or more problems. As a result, we are lost amid a variety of theories with no deeper guiding principle. We give a general review of existing approaches and discuss the current state of the art."

The aim of this preliminary study was to characterise the metabolic diversity of a novelBifidobacterium longumstrain, BIOCC 1719, of human origin. The change after 24 h cultivation in three media was assessed using a metabolomic approach. Milk-based substrates favoured the activity of the strain, promoting the production of B vitamins, essential amino acids, bile acids, and fatty acids. Vitamins B1, B2, B6, B7, and B12 (with an average increase of 20&30%) were produced in both whole milk and whey; the increased production in the latter was as high as 100% for B7 and 744% for B12. The essential amino acids methionine and threonine were produced (>38%) in both milk and whey, and there was an increased production of leucine (>50%) in milk and lysine (126%) in whey. Increases in the content of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) by 20%, deoxycholic acid in milk and whey (141% and 122%, respectively), and cholic acid (52%) in milk were recorded. During the preliminary characterisation of the metabolic diversity of the novelB. longumstrain, BIOCC 1719, we identified the bioactive compounds produced by the strain during fermentation. This suggests its potential use as a postbiotic ingredient to enrich the human diet."

We investigated the interplay between CP and HCPro during these viral processes. While the endogenous HCPro and a heterologous viral suppressor of gene silencing both complemented HCPro-less potato virus A (PVA) expression, CP stabilization connected to particle formation could be complemented only by the cognate PVA HCPro. We found that HCPro relieves CP-mediated inhibition of PVA RNA expression likely by enabling HCPro-mediated sequestration of CPs to particles. We addressed the question about the role of replication in formation of PVA particles and gained evidence for encapsidation of non-replicating PVA RNA. The extreme instability of these particles substantiates the need for replication in the formation of stable particles. During replication, viral protein genome linked (VPg) becomes covalently attached to PVA RNA and can attract HCPro, cylindrical inclusion protein and host proteins. Based on the results of the current study and our previous findings we propose a model in which a large ribonucleoprotein complex formed around VPg at one end of PVA particles is essential for their integrity."

We contribute to this literature by investigating the effects on the transition to second and third births of a policy reform that introduced generous earnings-dependent parental leave benefit in Estonia in 2004. Our study employs a mixture cure model, a model with some useful properties that has been seldom applied in fertility research. The advantage of the cure model over conventional event history models is the ability to distinguish the effect of the covariates on the propensity to have a next child from their effect on the tempo of childbearing. The results show that the transition to next birth accelerated as parents responded to so-called speed premium, a feature that allowed them to avoid a reduction in benefits caused by a reduction of earned income between births, through the closer spacing of births. Furthermore, the findings suggest that the introduction of generous earning-related parental leave was associated with a substantial increase in the progression to both second and third births."

To exhibit benefits to human health, probiotics have to fulfill several criteria (14,15). It must have excellent technological properties so that it can be manufactured and incorporated into food products without losing viability and functionality (16,17). It has to survive through the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract and arrive alive at its site of action, as well as being able to function in the gut environment (6,18). Several recent studies indicated that the yeastS. boulardiicould survive in a wide range of temperatures and pH levels (19,20). Besides,S. boulardiihas a strong affinity to various stresses like the presence of GI enzymes, bile salts, and organic acids (19,21).S. boulardiibenefits the GI tract in a variety of ways. It inactivates bacterial toxins, inhibits toxin binding to intestinal cell receptors, and reduces toxin-induced inflammation (22,23). It inhibits the ability of potentially harmful microorganisms and invades intestinal cells (9).S. boulardiistimulates host immune systems and intestinal enzymes that enhance nutrient digestion and absorption (24). In support of these distinctive mechanisms, the live yeastS. boulardiiis used extensively as a probiotic and is often marketed as a dietary supplement (10,25). However,S. boulardiibelongs to the group of simple eukaryotic cells; it thus differs from bacterial probiotics that are prokaryotes. In a study, it was reported thatS. boulardiiCNCM I-745 influences the gut-associated immune system (26). Furthermore, the previous reports indicated that this yeast decreased the incidence of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (9,26) and diminished the risk of recurrence ofClostridium difficile-associated and Crohn's diseases (27).S. boulardiiwas also used for lactose intolerance, urinary tract infections (UTIs), vaginal yeast infections, high cholesterol levels, fever blisters, and teenage acne (25,28,29). Considering the beneficial aspects, the present study was undertaken to isolate and characterize the yeastS. boulardiiand investigate its ability to tolerate different concentrations of bile salt, cell hydrophobicity, antioxidants, autoaggregation activity, and simulated gastrointestinal digestion. The probiotic activities were conducted in response to a different temperature, pH, and salinity (NaCl). Furthermore, the antagonistic spectrum ofS. boulardiiwas analyzed using various bacterial pathogens related to diarrhea diseases. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive report on a promisingS. boulardiistrain in Bangladesh. The experimental findings will give new insight for immunoblastic uses ofS. boulardiias a therapeutic agent."

Such an understanding has the potential to guide research by highlighting barriers for process mining adoption and, thus, can contribute to successful process mining initiatives in practice. In this respect, the paper provides a holistic view of opportunities and challenges for process mining in organizations identified in a Delphi study with 40 international experts from academia and industry. Besides proposing a set of 30 opportunities and 32 challenges, the paper conveys insights into the comparative relevance of individual items, as well as differences in the perceived relevance between academics and practitioners.

This research aims to investigate the factors affecting BIM adoption for building permits through a case study of a public organization currently developing and piloting a BIM-based building permit process. A thematic analysis of semi-structured interview data revealed ten factors that influence BIM adoption for building permits: complexity (in both development and use) of a BIM-based building permit system; relative advantages/disadvantages of BIM for building permits; the existing building permit system; management support for a BIM-based building permit process; organizational culture; BIM awareness; training and learning; available expertise for a BIM-based building permit process; external pressure; and legal context. The findings are important for public authorities' understanding of both the enablers and challenges of the BIM-based building permit process, and have practical implications for professionals in public authorities in particular, and also the Architecture Engineering Construction/Facilities Management (AEC/FM) industry in general, to guide their steps towards adopting BIM.

After SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)&related CoV, COVID-19 is the third most pathogenic virus, hazardous to humans which have raised worries concerning the capacity of current security measures and the human services framework to deal with such danger.Recent FindingsAccording to WHO, the mortality rate of COVID-19 exceeded that of SARS and MERS in view of which COVID-19 was declared as public health emergency of international concern. Coronaviruses are positive-sense RNA viruses with single stranded RNA and non-segmented envelopes. Recently, genome sequencing confirmed that COVID-19 is similar to SARS-CoV and bat coronavirus, but the major source of this pandemic outbreak, its transmission, and mechanisms related to its pathogenicity to humans are not yet known.SummaryIn order to prevent the further pandemic and loss to humanity, scientists are studying the development of therapeutic drugs, vaccines, and strategies to cure the infections. In this review, we present a brief introduction to emerging and re-emerging pathogens, i.e., coronavirus in humans and animals, its taxonomic classification, genome organization, its replication, pathogenicity, impact on socioeconomic growth, and drugs associated with COVID-19."

The methodology is composed of a participatory co-design approach with quantitative and qualitative data sources, including background research on industry mapping and economic statistical indicators, semi-structured interviews with industry professionals and stakeholders, and co-design workshops with local creatives. Data were collected from recordings and transcribed, and the co-design workshop post-it notes were digitalised. The data were analysed from the bottom-up and mapped top-down with the 21st-century skills and ecosystem approach. Our current studies show that knowledge transfer and collaboration (across industry sectors, NGOs, and academia) are critical in a small country with a small population, intertwined with dynamic ecosystem building. Creative people upscale and continuously deepen their professional skills (digital and non-digital) in a lifelong learning manner.

Though extremozymes were identified several decades ago, researchers are still concentrating more on genetic engineering of existing enzymes to potentiate their activity and the screening of novel enzymes from various sources to obtain the necessary characteristics amenable for industrial and biotechnological applications (Figure 1). Many research groups and companies around the world are committed to engineering microorganisms genetically with desirable industrial characteristics suitable for their industrial operations (Hermann et al., 2018). Many common commercial enzymes cannot meet the industrial requirements, such as being able to withstand industrial requirements with high reproducibility in different pH, temperature, and aerification conditions. Therefore, extremozymes have received increased attention as a strategy of industry process and biorefining (Espliego et al., 2018). Novozymes and Genesco have commercialized cold-adapted amylases and proteases that can eliminate starch stains (Dumorn√É¬© et al., 2017). Industrial enzymes, such as those used in biorefinery, are considered as technical enzymes, and they were valued for more than $ 1 billion in 2010 and are expected to grow to $5.0 billion in 2021 at a rate of 4.0% per year (Kuila and Sharma, 2017). This was surpassed earlier, as they reached $5.5 billion in 2018 and are now projected to reach $7.0 billion by 2023 by several research associations (Freedonia, 2018;Research Biotechnology, 2018;Silveira et al., 2018). Also, a report pointed out that the global market for special enzymes (including extremozymes) reached $4.0 billion in 2018.

The torrefaction industry can take advantage of this, as the fuel characteristics of torrefied biomasses are comparable to those of coal. However, in terms of economic feasibility, torrefied biomass pellets are not yet competitive with coal without subsidies because of the high price of woody biomass. Thus, there is a need to produce torrefied pellets from low-cost feedstock; pulp industry sludge is one such feedstock. In this context, this study was focused on the torrefaction of pulp industry sludge. Torrefaction experiments were carried out using a continuous reactor, at temperatures of 250, 275, and 300 √Ç¬∞C. The heating value of the sludge increased from 19 to 22 MJ/kg after torrefaction at 300 √Ç¬∞C. The fixed carbon content increased from 16 wt.% for dried pulp sludge to 30 wt.% for torrefied pulp sludge. The fuel ratio was in the range of 0.27 to 0.61. The ash content of the pulp sludge was comparable to that of agricultural waste, i.e., around 12 wt.% (dry basis). The cellulose content in the sludge was reduced from 35 to 12 wt.% at 300 √Ç¬∞C. Ash related issues such as slagging, fouling, and bed agglomeration tendency of the sludge were moderate.

However, what transpires after the attainment of any individual concept (such as ICE or ICC) remains uncharted in the IC research literature. This study aims to answer this question by proposing a comprehensive model of IC (CMIC) that links four major concepts of IC as the phases necessary for adapting to a new culture. The model proposes that a student must be effective (ICE) which then paves the path for competence (ICC), leading to adjustment (ICA) in an intercultural setting. Upon successfully navigating these three stages, there is a probability that they can adapt (ICA) to the new culture. The following section explains the differences in the supportive literature and proposes CMIC."

This study aimed to investigate the impact of RIPC on the metabolomical profile of LEAD patients undergoing these procedures and to elucidate its potential underlying mechanisms. A total of 100 LEAD patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to either the RIPC group (n = 46) or the sham group (n = 54). Blood samples were drawn before and 24 h after intervention. Targeted metabolomics analysis was performed using the AbsoluteIDQ p180 Kit, and changes in metabolite concentrations were compared between the groups. The RIPC group demonstrated significantly different dynamics in nine metabolites compared to the sham group, which generally showed a decrease in metabolite concentrations. The impacted metabolites included glutamate, taurine, the arginine-dimethyl-amide-to-arginine ratio, lysoPC a C24:0, lysoPC a C28:0, lysoPC a C26:1, PC aa C38:1, PC ae C30:2, and PC ae C44:3. RIPC exhibited a √¢‚Ç¨Àústabilization' effect, maintaining metabolite levels amidst ischemia-reperfusion injuries, suggesting its role in enhancing metabolic control. This may improve outcomes for LEAD patients. However, additional studies are needed to definitively establish causal relationships among these metabolic changes."

The main goal of this paper was to conduct a content analysis on RE development policies in Iran's five-year National Development Plan (NDP) by investigating upstream national documents. To achieve the goal, 29 upstream documents related to RE were identified and analyzed through a systematic literature review. Then, a qualitative content analysis was applied to analyze the documents. The results showed that Iran's current RE policies need to be reviewed, reformed, and strengthened. For example, lack of sufficient attention to renewable heat and fuel was one of the deficiencies of RE policies in Iran's five-year NDP. The decentralization of policymaking in the unified organization was also one of the weaknesses in the policymaking process of the RE. Iran can develop sustainable and clean RE policies by using sources such as solar, wind, geothermal, hydropower, wave, and tidal power. The paper concludes that, although RE policies have the potential for development in Iran due to environmental, social, and economic advantages, they could face some infrastructural, managerial, socio-cultural, and economic challenges. Accordingly, effective and innovative policymaking is required to meet such challenges."

However, RESs have many limitations like their intermittent nature and availability at far-off sites from the major load centers. This paper presents the forecasting of wind speed and power using the implementation of the Feedforward and cascaded forward neural networks (FFNNs and CFNNs, respectively). The one and half year's dataset for Jhimpir, Pakistan, is used to train FFNNs and CFNNs with recently developed novel metaheuristic optimization algorithms, i.e., hybrid particle swarm optimization (PSO) and a Bat algorithm (BA) named HPSOBA, along with a modified hybrid PSO and BA with parameter-inspired acceleration coefficients (MHPSO-BAAC), without and with the constriction factor (MHPSO-BAAC-√è‚Ä°). The forecasting results are made for June&October 2019. The accuracy of the forecasted values is tested through the mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and root mean square error (RMSE). The graphical and numerical comparative analysis was performed for both feedforward and cascaded forward neural networks that are tuned using the mentioned optimization techniques. The feedforward neural network was achieved through the implementation of HPSOBA with a mean absolute error, mean absolute percentage error, and root mean square error of 0.0673, 6.73%, and 0.0378, respectively. Whereas for the case of forecasting through a cascaded forward neural network, the best performance was attained by the implementation of MHPSO-BAAC with a MAE, MAPE and RMSE of 0.0112, 1.12%, and 0.0577, respectively. Thus, the mentioned neural networks provide a more accurate prediction when trained and tuned through the given optimization algorithms, which is evident from the presented results."

Presently, the development and implementation of renewable energy systems are ensured mainly through state funding, the possibilities of which are limited. The potential of attracting private investments depends directly on their impact on companies' profitability indicators, and the uncertainty regarding the return on investments is one of the main barriers affecting investors' decision-making. Based on a vector autoregressive model for analysing the stationary time series, the paper explores the impact of long-term investments and research and development costs in renewable energy technologies on the financial performance of ten of the largest companies operating in this field. The study's results showed that investments and spending on research and development positively affect such companies' profitability indicators as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation, earnings before interest and tax, net income, and return on investment. The obtained results can be used to substantiate the economic effectiveness of investments in developing and improving renewable energy technologies when forming the companies' financial policies to support them."

Thematic analysis of the data revealed that competition is pervasive and appeared in most themes relating to integrity. The structural frameworks for research such as funding, evaluation and publication were thought to both protect and, more commonly, undermine integrity. In addition, institutional systems, including workload and research governance, shaped participants' day-to-day work environment, also affecting research integrity. Participants also provided ideas for promoting research integrity, including training, and creating conditions that would be supportive of research integrity.These findings support a shift away from individual blame and towards the need for structural and institutional changes, including organisations in the wider research environment, for example funding bodies and publishing companies."

However, the attention of scholars and policymakers has mainly been on large multinational enterprises, with small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) receiving less attention. Recent studies have noted the importance of learning for SMEs to engage in corporate social responsibility (CSR), but it is not yet known how the learning orientation of SMEs impacts their CSR, and how the development impacts the internationalization and performance of SMEs, which are research gaps that recent studies have noted. Shedding light on those dynamics is also important from a practical perspective since in most countries SMEs constitute a large majority of firms in both amounts and total employment. The present study contributes by illustrating how CSR impacts different types of performance in SMEs, and how the learning orientation of SMEs predetermines their CSR. Regression analyses conducted on an empirical sample of Finnish SMEs indicate that CSR in SMEs has an impact on certain types of performance and that their learning orientation determines their CSR. Therefore, the study contributes to the literature on responsibility and sustainability in SMEs, and to that SME internationalization, by shedding light on the antecedents and outcomes of CSR for SMEs."

Pretreatment is a highly expensive and energy-consuming step in lignocellulosic biomass processing. Therefore, it is vital to study and optimize different pretreatment methods to find a most efficient production process. The biomass was milled with the Szego Mill√¢‚Äû¬¢ using three different approaches: dry milling, wet milling and for the first time nitrogen assisted wet milling was tested. Bioethanol and biogas production were studied, but also fibre analysis and SEM (scanning electron microscope) analysis were carried out to characterize the effect of different milling approaches. In addition, two different process flows were used to evaluate the efficiency of downstream processing steps. The results show that pretreatment of barely straw with the Szego Mill√¢‚Äû¬¢ enabled obtaining glucose concentrations of up to 7 g L√¢ÀÜ‚Äô1in the hydrolysis mixture, which yields at hydrolysis efficiency of 18%. The final ethanol concentrations from 3.4 to 6.7 g L√¢ÀÜ‚Äô1were obtained. The lowest glucose and ethanol concentrations were measured when the biomass was dry milled, the highest when nitrogen assisted wet milling was used. Milling also resulted in an 6&11% of increase in methane production rate during anaerobic digestion of straw."

Thirty-three highly trained RG girls and 20 UC girls aged 14&18 years participated in this cross-sectional study. Height, body mass, body composition, energy intake, resting energy expenditure, training volume and different blood biochemical markers were measured. The body attitude test (BAT) was used to evaluate the BIP of the participants. There were no differences in the total BAT scores between the groups. In RGs, the BAT score correlated positively with the serum resistin level (r = 0.35;p= 0.047). A stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that 40.8% of the variability in the BAT score was determined by resistin and BMI. The association of BIP with resistin values was observed only in RGs. In conclusion, our findings add to the increasing evidence that resistin may be a link between BIP and body composition, most likely through fat mass, in adolescent female RGs."

Three types of modifications, 2√¢‚Ç¨¬≤-O-methylation of ribose moiety, pseudouridylation, and base modifications, are introduced either by a snoRNA-driven mechanism or by stand-alone enzymes. Modified nucleotides are clustered at the functionally important sites, including peptidyl transferase center (PTC). Therefore, it has been hypothesised that the modified nucleotides play an important role in ensuring the functionality of the ribosome. In this study, we demonstrate that seven 25S rRNA modifications, including four evolutionarily conserved modifications, in the proximity of PTC can be simultaneously depleted without loss of cell viability. Yeast mutants lacking three snoRNA genes (snR34,snR52,andsnR65) and/or expressing enzymatically inactive variants ofspb1(D52A/E679K)andnop2(C424A/C478A)were constructed. The results show that rRNA modifications in PTC contribute collectively to efficient translation in eukaryotic cells. The deficiency of seven modified nucleotides in 25S rRNA resulted in reduced cell growth, cold sensitivity, decreased translation levels, and hyperaccurate translation, as indicated by the reduced missense and nonsense suppression. The modification m5C2870 is crucial in the absence of the other six modified nucleotides. Thus, the pattern of rRNA-modified nucleotides around the PTC is essential for optimal ribosomal translational activity and translational fidelity."

The sample material was characterized through magnetic measurements. The study showed excellent DC magnetic properties, comparable to commercial and other 3D printed soft ferromagnetic materials from the literature at low (1 T) magnetization. Empirical total core losses were segregated into hysteresis, eddy and excessive losses via the subtraction of finite element method (FEM) simulated eddy current losses and hysteresis losses measured at quasi-static conditions. Hysteresis losses were found to decrease from 3.65 to 0.95 W/kg (1 T, 50 Hz) after the annealing. Both empirical and FEM results confirm considerable eddy currents generated in the printed bulk toroidal sample, which increase dramatically at high material saturation after annealing. These losses could potentially be reduced by using partitioned material internal structure realized by printed airgaps. Similarly, with regard to the samples characterized in this study, the substantially increased core losses induced by material oversaturation due to reduced filling factor may present a challenge in realizing 3D printed electrical machines with comparable performance to established 2D laminated designs."

The shore processes associated with climate change have remarkably accelerated over recent decades. Many sandy shores have suffered from strong erosion, including an excellent former beach at Valgeranna. The jetties, which were built in the 1860s to protect the navigation channel of Port P‰rnu from clogging, have prevented natural sediment transport along the coast from south to north. At the same time, the sandy beach in P‰rnu is expanding, and part of the sand accumulates with strong storms also in between the jetties, reducing the width of the shipping channel. The channel needs regular dredging, but, so far, the dredged sediment has been taken far away to the open sea and accumulated on the seabed. The current paper addresses the possibilities of using that sand for beach restoration in destructed and eroded areas. An overview of the applied methods and measurements during field studies is given. The results of modelling the processes of wave activity and sediment transport are discussed. The recycling of shore sediments is an important measure in sustainable coastal zone management. Different options and scenarios are analysed in order to find the most reasonable ways to bring sand back onto beaches and stabilize natural processes. Support from the state by working out respective laws and regulations would be motivating as well."

(2) Which contextual factors would demonstrate the highest frequency of statistically significant relationships with SEL program implementation quality indicators and could therefore be more essential for ensuring the program outcomes? Determining the more significant contextual factors would allow for more focused and better-informed teacher professional development for supporting students' social and emotional skills, it can also be useful for hypothesis development for quasi- experimental research designs of SEL program implementation on the school level. A systematic literature search was conducted in seven electronic databases and resulted in an initial sample of 1,281 records and additional journal and citation sampling of 19 additional records. 20 articles met the final inclusion criteria for the study (19 quantitative and one mixed methods). Inductive content analysis and quantitative analysis were employed to map the variables and estimate the relative frequency of statistically significant relationships across studies. Four categories of contextual factors were revealed: program support, school, teacher, and student categories. The results of the study reveal the diversity in contextual factors studied across SEL program implantation quality and bolster the relevance of program support factors (modeling activities during coaching and teacher&coach working relationship) for ensuring implementation quality. A link between teacher burnout and program dosage was revealed. Student factors emerged as a separate contextual level in school, with special attention to student baseline self-regulation that may influence SEL program implementation quality."

Participants also responded to a questionnaire about physical activity habits, overall health, and attitudes about the importance of physical activity among students. About 92.6% of the participants met the World Health Organisation's weekly physical activity recommendation. However, 69.1% of the accelerometer wearing time was spent being sedentary. Only 5.8% of the wearing time was spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity. More active school personnel believed their lead affects students' attitudes towards physical activity (r = 0.072&0.156,p< 0.05) and being active at recess facilitates a peaceful learning environment in the classroom (r = 0.064&0.072,p< 0.05).

All the fabricated electrodes showed close to Nernstian sensitivity, good linearity, fast response, small drift, low hysteresis, and low cross-sensitivity toward various interfering cations and anions. Furthermore, decreasing the sintering temperature led to better adhesion of the RuO2layer and a negligible response to interfering ions. The measurements in real-life samples from different water sources showed that the fabricated electrodes are on par with conventional glass electrodes with a maximum deviation of 0.11 pH units, thus indicating their potential for application in water quality monitoring."

Lists of MP species according to different MP definition scenarios are available. The ratio of MP species in the local plant species list was the largest in alvars, followed by floodplain and wooded meadows. The average number of MP species in wooded meadows and alvars was about twice of that found in naturally growing broadleaved forest (according to the most detailed MP species list, 7.2, 7.8 and 4.3 plot√¢ÀÜ‚Äô1, respectively). Fertilization of wooded meadows had no significant impact on MP species ratio, but decreased the percentage of MP biomass. Coastal meadows had few MP species and the impact of management quality depended on adopted MP scenarios. Comparison of Ellenberg indicator values revealed that MP species were more drought-tolerant, with higher commonness and more anthropophyte than the rest of studied grassland species."

Here, we choose the LambertWnormal distribution as a natural starting point and include the LambertWexponential distribution due to the simplicity and shape of the exponential distribution, which, after skewing, may produce a reasonably heavy tail for loss models. In the theoretical part, we focus on the mathematical properties of obtained distributions, including the range of skewness.

However, a suitable and cost-effective methodology to study the utilization of peptides by yeast and other microorganisms in a complex peptide mixture has yet to be put forward. This article addresses this issue by presenting a screening methodology for tracking the consumption of peptides by yeast during alcoholic fermentation. As a peptide source, the methodology makes use of an in-house prepared peptide-mapped bovine serum albumin (BSA) proteolytic digest, which was applied to a synthetic grape must. The peptide uptake was analyzed using high-throughput ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography coupled to data-independent acquisition-based ion mobility separation-enabled high-resolution mass spectrometry (UPLC-DIA-IMS-HRMS) analysis. The relative changes of abundance of 123 di- to hexapeptides were monitored and reported during fermentations with three commercial wine strains, demonstrating different uptake kinetics for individual peptides. Using the same peptide-mapped BSA hydrolysate, the applicability of an untargeted workflow was additionally assessed for peptide profiling in unelucidated matrixes. The comparison of the results from peptide mapping and untargeted analysis experiments highlighted the ability of untargeted analysis to consistently identify small molecular weight peptides on the length and amino acid composition. The proposed method, in combination with other analytical techniques, such as gene or protein expression analysis, can be a useful tool for different metabolic studies related to the consumption of complex nitrogen sources by yeast or other microorganisms."

Smart cities","Sharing Internet of Things (IoT) data across different sectors, such as in smart cities, becomes complex due to heterogeneity. This poses challenges related to a lack of interoperability, data quality issues and lack of context information, and a lack of data veracity (or accuracy). In addition, there are privacy concerns as IoT data may contain personally identifiable information. To address the above challenges, this paper presents a novel semantic technology-based framework that enables data sharing in a GDPR-compliant manner while ensuring that the data shared is interoperable, contains required context information, is of acceptable quality, and is accurate and trustworthy. The proposed framework also accounts for the edge/fog, an upcoming computing paradigm for the IoT to support real-time decisions. We evaluate the performance of the proposed framework with two different edge and fog‚Äìedge scenarios using resource-constrained IoT devices, such as the Raspberry Pi. In addition, we also evaluate shared data quality, interoperability and veracity. Our key finding is that the proposed framework can be employed on IoT devices with limited resources due to its low CPU and memory utilization for analytics operations and data transformation and migration operations. The low overhead of the framework supports real-time decision making. In addition, the 100% accuracy of our evaluation of the data quality and veracity based on 180 different observations demonstrates that the proposed framework can guarantee both data quality and veracity."

However, shipping activities have negative environmental impacts, including emissions to air and water. The Baltic Sea is severely affected by eutrophication, mainly due to nutrient inputs, especially nitrogen and phosphorus. Understanding the contributions of various nutrient sources is essential for informed environmental regulation. The aim of this research is to quantify the nutrient content of black and grey water discharged from cargo ships in the Baltic Sea in order to assess their contribution to the total nutrient load. Specifically, this research examines the nitrogen and phosphorus loadings from ships calling the port of HaminaKotka and addresses key questions regarding nutrient generation, discharge proportions, emission shares by ship type, and their importance compared to other sources. Using a methodology based on ship data and nutrient production estimates, this study found that 2545 cargo ships generated a total of 781 kg of nitrogen and 134 kg of phosphorus in their effluents during their voyages to the port in 2021. However, only a small fraction (0.5%) of the cargo ships discharged their wastewater at port reception facilities. This study concludes that nutrient discharges from cargo ships' wastewaters are relatively small, contributing less than 0.06% phosphorus and 0.01% nitrogen to the total load in the area. This result indicates that the impact of cargo ships' wastewater on the eutrophication of the Baltic Sea is smaller than previously thought. The methodology used in this study can be applied in other ports and regions to assess nutrient discharges from cargo ships' wastewaters on a wider scale. Further research is recommended to assess the effectiveness of on-board treatment systems, the impact of other contaminants in wastewater, and the development of port reception facilities to facilitate proper wastewater management in the maritime trade."

Although teachers' knowledge and skills are considered a key factor for successful inclusive practice, the whole school staff commitment and contribution to implementing IE policies are equally important. Collaboration between different professionals such as teachers, school leaders, and support specialists is crucial. This study aimed to design and implement an in-service training course for school teams (teachers, support specialists, school leaders) on IE in the Estonian context and to explore how participants experienced learning as a team in this course. The results of this study showed that the main aspects of the in-service training for school teams valued by participants were: (1) All topics covered in a systematic and coherent way gave a good opportunity to focus on relevant issues, which should be considered in the schools' self-development activities in the field of IE; (2) practical approach to training structure helped to identify priority areas that need to be developed in particular schools; (3) learning from each other both within their own school team and across school teams contributed to finding the best solutions for meaningful implementation of IE. The implication of these findings is further discussed in the paper."

However, different research groups have used divergent assay protocols, scarcely reporting the systematic optimization of the assay. Here, we perform extensive studies to fine-tune the experimental protocols utilizing resazurin-based viability sensing. Specifically, we focus on (A) optimization of the assay dynamic range in individual cell lines for the correct measurement of cytostatic and cytotoxic properties of the compounds; (B) dependence of the dynamic range on the physical quantity detected (fluorescence intensity versus change of absorbance spectrum); (C) calibration of the assay for the correct interpretation of data measured in hypoxic conditions; and (D) possibilities for combining the resazurin assay with other methods including measurement of necrosis and apoptosis. We also demonstrate the enhanced precision and flexibility of the resazurin-based assay regarding the readout format and kinetic measurement mode as compared to the widely used analogous assay which utilizes tetrazolium dye MTT. The discussed assay optimization guidelines provide useful instructions for the beginners in the field and for the experienced scientists exploring new ways for measurement of cellular viability using resazurin."

This work presents a structure-based drug discovery strategy to validate the Lmj_04_BRCT domain as a novel therapeutic target inLeishmaniaspp. The structure of this domain was explored using homology modeling, virtual screening, and molecular dynamics studies. Candidate compounds were validated in vitro using promastigotes ofLeishmania major,L. amazonensis, andL. infantum, as well as primary mouse macrophages infected withL. major. The novel inhibitor CPE2 emerged as the most active of a group of compounds againstLeishmania, being able to significantly reduce the viability of promastigotes. CPE2 was also active against the intracellular forms of the parasites and significantly reduced parasite burden in murine macrophages without exhibiting toxicity in host cells. Furthermore,L. majorpromastigotes treated with CPE2 showed significant lower expression levels of several genes (√é¬±-tubulin,Cyclin CYCA, andYip1) related to proliferation and treatment resistance. Our in silico and in vitro studies suggest that the Lmj_04_BRCT domain and its here disclosed inhibitors are new potential therapeutic options against leishmaniasis."

Thus, this paper proposes incorporating ultralocal model (ULM) control into LFC to enhance microgrid (√Ç¬µG) frequency stability. ULM controllers are regarded as model-free controllers that yield high rejection rates for disturbances caused by load/RES uncertainties. Typically, ULM parameters are set using trial-and-error methods, which makes it difficult to determine the optimal values that will provide the best system performance and stability. To address this issue, the African vultures optimization algorithm (AVOA) was applied to fine-tune the ULM parameters, thereby stabilizing the system frequency despite different disturbances. The proposed LFC controller was compared with the traditional secondary controller based on an integral controller to prove its superior performance. For several contingencies, the simulation results demonstrated that the proposed controller based on the optimal ULM coupled with LFC could significantly promote RESs into the √Ç¬µG."

In the coronavirus pandemic era, these policies were taken even more to the extreme. In 2021, countries around the world started to experience product availability issues, and inflation in some cases was extremely high. There has been debate about the possibility of persistent high inflation. However, risks to assets and foreign trade in this new situation are unknown as all important hyperinflation cases are from decades to century-old. It is important to know what kind of implications high inflation has on modern economies. Therefore, in this study, 10 countries with the highest inflation were selected to be examined in the period of 2018&2020. In these countries, currencies lost a considerable amount of their value against US dollar in 2018&2020. Stock market indexes in many cases provided very high returns in local currency terms; however, against the US dollar, the index yield changed for the substantially negative. Apartment prices in general declined as well. In foreign trade, imports generally declined, while exports were mixed or even increased. However, it should be noted that all of these observations are influenced by the pandemic era and special circumstances of a particular country."

In addition, smallholder farms often have a more difficult time making profits from their labor, due to relatively small quantities of food produced, lack of social protection, dependency on less farm hands, and their disadvantage in supply chains. To provide for an exponentially growing human population, smallholder farming systems must undergo sustainable intensification, whereby crop yields are increased in a manner that minimizes environmental impacts without significantly greater expenditure of resources (e.g., water, land, labor costs). Traditional practices, together with newer technologies, have both been developed with the aim of aiding sustainable intensification in crop production; SDGs 1.4, 8.2, 9.4, and 9.5 (United Nations, 2022;Table 1) encourage greater adoption- and upgrades of technologies in developing countries. Indeed, sustainable intensification is likely to require a combination of both traditional- and biotechnological approaches to achieve the established SDGs."

In our study, these polypyrrole-gelatin trilayer actuators with choline acetate and choline isobutyrate showed the highest strain difference and highest efficiency in strain difference to charge density ratios compared to a reference system containing imidazolium-based ionic liquid and a traditional polyvinylidene fluoride (PVdF) membrane material. As neither the relative ion sizes nor the measured parameters of the ionic liquids could explain their behavior in the actuators, molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory calculations were conducted. Strong cation-cation clustering was found and the radial distribution functions provided further insight into the topic, showing that the cation-cation correlation peak height is a good predictor of strain difference of the actuators."

The increased integration of DGs and inverter based non-linear loads increases voltage quality issues, thus the cost-efficient assurance of voltage quality in LV grids with long radial lines is of increasing importance for the operators of municipal electricity distribution systems. Conventional methods for mitigating voltage quality issues (e.g., power line renovation) might not be optimal solutions either technologically or economically. Existing studies do not address all relevant issues related to the assurance of required voltage quality in such LV grids. This paper provides an overview of the applicability and rationality of traditional as well as alternative methods to solve voltage problems in LV grids. The authors use DIgSILENT PowerFactory software to simulate the performance of voltage stabilisers under different conditions. The authors propose a robust method for the classification of LV feeders and provide recommendations on how to resolve voltage quality problems, with the help of different power quality improvement devices, where the traditional methods of upgrading to medium voltage and grid reinforcement are economically infeasible. Based on our results, recommendations for mitigating voltage quality problems in LV distribution grids with radial lines of different lengths are given."

The focus of the research is on the use of participatory foresight for fostering smart energy transition on a municipal level, the key benefits and success factors that participatory foresight brings, and the replicability of this approach. Within the novel Cities4ZERO framework, an overarching methodology for a smart urban decarbonisation transition, guiding cities through the process of developing the most appropriate strategies, plans, projects, as well as looking for the commitment of key local stakeholders for an effective transition&foresight framework, was developed and tested in five pilot cities. Foresight as applied within the Cities4ZERO framework creates a participatory process which brings stakeholders together to achieve unified scenarios, and a common vision for future urban decarbonisation strategies. The methodology is replicable and increases the quality of strategic energy planning by fostering long-term system thinking."

Hybrid processes","So far, approaches for business process modeling, enactment and monitoring have mainly been based on process specifications consisting of a single process model. This setting aptly captures monolithic scenarios from domains in which all possible behaviors can be folded into a single model. However, the same strategy cannot be applied to domains where multiple interacting (procedural) processes simultaneously work over the same objects, in the presence of additional (declarative) constraints relating activities from the same or different processes. A relevant example for this setting is that of healthcare, where co-morbid patients may be subject to multiple clinical pathways at once, in the presence of additional, general constraints capturing basic medical knowledge. To fill this gap, we have previously presented the M3 Framework and an accompanying monitoring technique, which allows for a hybrid representation of a process using both procedural and declarative models, and supports the modular creation of multi-process specifications where domain experts can focus on specific procedures and domain constraints without being forced to merge them into one single specification. In this paper, we make significant extensions to this framework, allowing us to go from simple toy examples towards addressing practical real-life scenarios. We achieve this by introducing a richer form of integration between the interacting process components, in particular supporting asynchronous and synchronous activities that may operate over local and global (shared) data variables. This is framed by a discussion of the business meaning of these concepts, the introduction of the corresponding modeling patterns, and the application of our approach to real-life business processes, the latter being the driving-force behind this paper."

Reducing the tillage intensity has been suggested as an alternative to conventional tillage for sustaining soil quality. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of soil tillage systems on individual soil quality indicators in comparison to those on grassland with Stagnic Luvisol soil in Estonia. Four soil management systems were compared: no-tillage (NT), minimum tillage (MT), conventional tillage (CT) and grassland (G) as a reference. Soil quality indicators included physical (bulk density, water-stable aggregates, porosity, air-filled pores, moisture content, water-holding capacity, penetration resistance and water permeability), chemical (total N, total soil organic C, permanganate oxidisable C, pH, P, K, Ca and Mg) and biological (earthworm abundance) parameters. CT soils had a significantly lower aggregate stability compared to MT and G soils. The higher penetration resistance of CT under an arable layer suggested the presence of a plough pan. NT improved the soil's physical quality at 5&10 cm, which was indicated by higher moisture content, water-holding capacity and porosity and a lower bulk density, whereas penetration resistance exceeded 2 MPa in the lower part of the topsoil. NT also had significantly lower total soil organic C and total N compared to MT and G. The absence of tillage in the NT and G systems may have improved the soil's resistance to moisture loss under dry conditions, which, in turn, improved the soil habitability for earthworms a despite higher density. In general, NT or MT stabilised or increased the soil quality compared to CT."

Numerous genotypes are needed to maintain genetic diversity in reforestation and, at the same time, are a prerequisite for the efficient improvement of breeding traits. Norway spruce is also highly susceptible to Heterobasidion root rot. We analysed the data from the SE initiations of Norway spruce from six different years, including a total of 126 families and almost 13,000 initiations, and used several genetic (including allele PaLAR3B improving Heterobasidion resistance), environmental, and operational variables to explain the initiation success and the number of cryopreserved embryogenic tissue (ET). Overall, the cone collection date was the best and most comprehensive single variable for predicting the initiation success and the number of cryopreserved ET in the logistic regression models. PaLAR3B allele did not interfere with SE initiation or the cryopreservation. In the optimal scenario, according to the current data, Norway spruce cones would be collected in southern Finland during the first two weeks of July (in approximately 800 d.d. accumulation) from the seed orchard or greenhouse and delivered quickly to the laboratory, and the cones would be cold-stored for five days or less before initiations on mLM media. Lower initiation frequencies in some families can be compensated by increasing the number of explants: however, taking operational limitations into account."

It has been commonly stated in the literature that protein denaturation leads to higher bond strength by activating the surface and exposing the reactive groups. Therefore, we investigated how differences in surface reactive groups (surface hydrophobicity and reactive amine groups) brought on with different denaturation treatments relate to bonding performance. Fourteen soy protein isolates (SPIs) with different denaturation histories were investigated. Characterization of the SPIs included surface hydrophobicity, surface amine content, extent of protein hydrolysis, and bond strength (wet and dry, with and without polyamidoamine epichlorohydrin (PAE) crosslinking agent) by ASTM D7998. The molecular weight patterns showed that proteins denatured by extensive hydrolysis had very low bond strengths. Adding the crosslinker, PAE, improved all the shear strength values. We found that the number of water-accessible reactive amine groups on protein surfaces had no impact on the adhesive strength, even with the amine-reactive crosslinker, PAE. Conversely, increased surface hydrophobicity was beneficial to adhesive strength in all cases, though this correlation was only statistically significant for wet strength without PAE. While, in general, denatured proteins are typically thought to form better bonds than native state proteins, this work suggests that it matters how proteins are denatured, and what surfaces become exposed. Denaturation by hydrolysis did not improve bond strength, and extensive hydrolysis seemed highly detrimental. Moreover, exposing hydrophobic surface groups was beneficial, but exposing covalent bond-forming reactive amine groups was not."

This paper elaborates on land&sea interfaces, which can integrate certain socio-cultural values and related tensions into maritime spatial planning (MSP). In this article, three regional case studies from Estonia, Latvia, and Poland analysed important intersections between the formations of cultural values and spatial dynamics within MSP processes. These cases make it possible to address current challenges, contested boundaries, and spatial planning possibilities to embrace the vibrant and complex ways the sea becomes connected to societal change. The study indicates the multiplicity of land&sea interfaces, which should be involved in MSP through situated places of terraqueous interactions, means of public participation, and meaningful boundaries within mobilised co-existence. The actual and possible tensions in allocating new functions of maritime spaces indicate the importance of coastal landscapes and communities. Thus, MSP practice can employ the land&sea interfaces to advance regional planning through participatory engagements, which reveal sociocultural linkages between society and environment on coastal areas."

Some of these fungi are strict specialists and only associate with one Nostoc phylogroup throughout their range, while others are generalists and associate with many different Nostoc phylogroups. We sampled 20 Peltigera taxa, mostly representing the Peltigera section Peltigera, from grassland and forest habitats across Europe. Mycobionts‚Äô identities were confirmed using fungal ITS sequences. The Nostoc cyanobionts were identified and grouped based on single nucleotide differences in the trnL region and on the phylogenetic analysis of the rbcLX region. Our data confirmed that some Peltigera species clearly prefer open habitats, while others are largely confined to shady forest habitats. The two habitat preferences are consistently paired with association with different Nostoc groups. As a specific example, two ecologically versatile species, Peltigera canina and P. didactyla, both growing in open and shady habitats, consistently associated with different groups of Nostoc when growing in different habitats. As associations between specific mycobionts and cyanobionts are influenced by habitat conditions, the diversity of both taxon groups should be considered in the context of habitat management and conservation planning."

Trad-SHM bioassay is traditionally done through manual counting and is a time-consuming process involving collecting the material, mounting the slide, observing it under the microscope, counting the cells, and then analyzing the data. To improve this process and reduce the examiner's workload and increase the assertiveness of cell counting process, image processing with color recognition was thought to optimize the manual counting process. However, computational classification ofTradescantiacells as blue or pink is not a trivial task. Visually, human eyes can easily distinguish between the two colors on the macro scale of the cell, but when observing the pixels closely, it is clear that there are many blue pixels in a pink cell and there are many pink pixels in a blue cell. Furthermore, there is great variability in the blue and pink tones from cell microscopy images. This study has three principal aims: (i) to investigate the sensibility ofTradescantiato air pollution and soil contamination; (ii) to build a novel dataset composed of single cell images fromTradescantiaclone 4430 plant, and (iii) to apply neural network architectures (TinyVGG, VGG-16, and ResNET34) capable of automatically classify cells into blue or pink classes. The idea is to build artificial intelligence algorithms that might allow fast identification of blue and pink cells in stamen hair images ofTradescantiaplants and facilitate quantification for subsequent statistical analysis. From an environmental point of view, by reducing time in the laboratory, there is the possibility of increasing the sampling area, covering possibly unseen critical areas via biomonitoring air, water, and/or soil quality. Furthermore, our dataset can be used as a resource for testing and validating automated image-analysis algorithms."

We employed Ecopath model for assessing food web structure in two fish-inhabited and one fishless lake in a pristine bog area. We hypothesized that: (a) fish absence will raise trophic positions of macroinvertebrate predators; (b) fish predation will lead to higher overall predation rates on zooplankton; (c) fish predation on large bodied zooplankton will result in top-down cascading effect, increasing phytoplankton biomasses. We found that fish have direct and indirect effects on zoobenthic communities. Chironomid biomass was greater and predatory macroinvertebrate groups had a higher trophic level in the fishless lake than in fish-inhabited lakes. Consumption rates of the benthic consumer fraction were greater than that of the planktonic fraction in the fishless lake; the opposite was found in the two lakes with fish. No effects of fish presence on zooplankton were found and we explain this partly by the low water transparency masking the impact of fish. Terrestrial insects constituted a crucial part of adult fish diet and we conclude that terrestrial secondary production contributes to the trophic support of fish communities in pristine bog lakes."

The crystalline structure and morphology were investigated with XRD, SEM and TEM. The optical properties of the as-prepared photocatalysts were investigated with Raman, FTIR, UV-Vis and photoluminescence spectroscopies. The influence of the phase proportions of Cu, Cu2O and Cu3N in the nanoparticle mixtures on the photocatalytic activity was also investigated. Overall, the sample containing the highest quantity of Cu3N exhibits the highest photocatalytic degradation efficiency (95%). This enhancement is attributed to factors such as absorption range broadening, increased specific surface of the photocatalysts and the downward band bending in the p-type semiconductors, i.e., Cu3N and Cu2O. Two different catalytic dosages were studied, i.e., 5 mg and 10 mg. The higher catalytic dosage exhibited lower photocatalytic degradation efficiency owing to the increase in the turbidity of the solution."

Hedgerows enhance aboveground biodiversity and provide ecosystem services, but little is known about their impact on soil biota. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are one of the key components of belowground biodiversity. We compared the diversity and composition of AM fungal communities at four farmland sites located in Central Spain, where 132 soil samples in total were collected to assess soil physical and chemical properties and the AM fungal communities. We compared the richness (number of AM fungal taxa), taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity, and structure of the AM fungal communities across three farmland habitat types, namely hedgerows, woody crops (olive groves and vineyard), and herbaceous crops (barley, sunflower, and wheat). Our results showed positive effects of hedgerows on most diversity metrics. Almost 60% of the AM fungal taxa were shared among the three farmland habitat types. Hedgerows increased AM fungal taxonomic richness (31%) and alpha diversity (25%), and especially so compared to herbaceous crops (45% and 28%, respectively). Hedgerows harbored elevated proportions of AM fungi with non-ruderal life-history strategies. AM fungal communities were more similar between hedgerows and woody crops than between hedgerows and adjacent herbaceous crops, possibly because of differences in tillage and fertilization. Unexpectedly, hedgerows reduced phylogenetic diversity, which might be related to more selective associations of AM fungi with woody plants than with herbaceous crops. Overall, the results suggest that planting hedgerows contributes to maintain belowground diversity. Thus, European farmers should plant more hedgerows to attain the goals of the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030."

This concern is reflected in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which emphasize, among other factors, sustainable cities and communities, responsible production and consumption, and climate action. Achieving sustainable natural resource management begins with raising awareness and educating the next generation. Therefore, it is essential to develop educational initiatives that prepare young people to become responsible and proactive adults in promoting environmental sustainability across industries and communities. Additionally, these initiatives should develop critical and analytical thinking skills, nurture innovative mindsets for creating environmentally sound solutions, and enhance the ability to collaborate within multidisciplinary teams. The NATURE project addressed these needs by designing and developing a serious educational game that fosters this set of skills. The results of the pilot testing show that the game is an effective tool and contributes to the education and awareness of the younger generation."

It is rich in mucilage and starch granules, making it a highly digestible ingredient. Mucilage can act as a matrix and a thickening, binding, emulsifying, or foaming agent in food, pharmaceutical, and several other fields of research. Moreover, mucilage can be extracted from several living organisms and has excellent functional properties, such as water-holding, oil-holding, and swelling capacities. Therefore, these remarkable functional properties make mucilage a promising ingredient with possible industrial applications. Furthermore, several extraction techniques, including enzyme-assisted, ultrasonication, microwave-assisted, aquatic, and solvent extraction methods, are used to obtain quantitative amounts of taro mucilage. Coldwater extraction with ethanol precipitation can be considered an effective and cost-effective technique to obtain high-quality mucilage with suitable industrial applications, whereas the ultrasonication method is more expensive but results in a higher amount of mucilage than other emerging techniques. Mucilage can also be used as a fat replacer or reducer, dye remover, coating agent, and antioxidating agent. Therefore, in this review, we detail the key properties related to the extraction techniques, chemical composition, and characterization of taro mucilage, along with its suitable applications and health benefits."

Whether it is a temporary change in learning methods caused by the COVID-19 restrictions or whether it will become a new normal is currently under discussion in many teacher training institutions around the world. The aim of this study was to design and implement time- and money-saving synchronous online teacher training format for conducting co-design courses for early childhood teachers in the theme of STEAM integrated learning activities. Based on Tallinn University's curriculum of in-person training courses on the same topic, with the volume of 40 contact hours, we delivered the content in two different formats: in 11-months (as it used to be in pre-COVID period) and in 4-months, adapted to participants' needs. We used a self-assessment survey, based on DigCompEdu framework, to assess the increase of digital competences in the two formats. The long-format course had 31 participants and the short-format course had 50 participants. The assessment was based on pre- and post-test and we used structured live video presentations to let participants retrospectively describe their learning experiences. Results indicate that the participants of both courses had improved their digital competences and achieved the learning outcomes set by course content. There was no significant difference in increase of digital competences or the way the course was perceived between participants of both courses. This brings us to the cautious consideration that it is possible to achieve desired outcomes of STEAM courses even in a shorter period when conducting them online compared to the in-person courses. There is a need for further research where results from participants of in-person and online teaching courses are compared."

For this, we first review the state of disciplinarity in TEL, reviewing existing meta-studies of the field. Then, we survey 35 doctoral education programs in Europe in which doctoral students working on TEL topics are enrolled. Findings indicate that most doctoral schools are associated with a single discipline and offer methodological rather than content-specific modules. TEL-specific content is provided only in exceptional cases, creating a potentially isolating gap between master-level education and scientific conferences. On this background, we argue that cross-institutional doctoral training is important to progress TEL as a field. In this article, we study and share the approach of an international doctoral summer school organized by the European society EA-TEL over the past 15 years. The summer school provides foundational methodological knowledge from multiple disciplines, content-specific topical knowledge in TEL, access to cutting edge scientific discourse, and discussion of horizontal issues to doctoral students. We further provide an analysis of shifting program topics over time. Our analysis of both, institutional as well as cross-institutional doctoral training in TEL, constitutes this paper's core contribution in that it highlights that further integration of perspectives and knowledge is to be done in TEL; together with codification and explication of knowledge in the intersection of disciplines."

In four concise chapters, the group of experts, consisting of Indigenous and non-Indigenous researchers and Indigenous rights holders, 1) guide the readership through the legal and political dimensions as well as that of research innovation and paradigmatic shifts in Arctic research; 2) it offers concrete methodological considerations in carrying out projects; 3) it elaborates on the participation of Indigenous rights holders in the EU research funding structures from a practice perspective. 4) it outlines the benefits of Indigenous-led Arctic research and of funding co-creative projects. This Roadmap can support the mainstreaming of co-creative and collaborative principles and equal partnership by Indigenous and non-Indigenous actors in 1) large-scale research projects, 2) calls for projects, 3) proposal design and project evaluation, and 4) in the implementation of the European Polar Research Program.
At the international level, the rights of Indigenous Peoples have been receiving increasing legal recognition. Similarly, EU calls-for-proposals ask nowadays increasingly for a ‚Äòco-design approach‚Äô in research (e.g., in the past Horizon 2020, and the current Horizon Europe funding schemes). Arctic researchers are increasingly adopting decolonial research approaches. Yet implementing decolonial research practices as new standards  and taking initiative that supports Indigenous sovereignty in the Arctic is often still lacking. Therefore, theoretical and methodological expertise about co-creation of knowledge, as offered in this Roadmap, can help to foster capacity among researchers in all disciplines (natural and social sciences, the humanities) and among the relevant funding bodies such as the EU Commission and the large variety of international and national funding organisations."

The braking process optimization is summarized from two aspects. First, the advantageous solutions are presented that were identified in the field of gradual and urgent braking. Second, several findings discovered in adjacent fields of automation are debated as prospects for their possible application in braking control. Following the specific classification of braking methods, a generalized braking system composition is offered, and all publications are evaluated primarily in terms of their energy recovery abilities as a global target. Then, conventional and intelligent classes of braking controllers are compared. In the first category, classic PID, threshold, and sliding-mode controllers are reviewed in terms of their energy management restrictions. The second group relates to the issues of the tire friction-slip identification and braking torque allocation between the hydraulic and electrical brakes. From this perspective, several intelligent systems are analyzed in detail, especially fuzzy logic, neural network, and their numerous associations."

However, actual classroom practices with regard to the use of games have not been examined on a larger scale. With this research, we gave teachers a voice to report on their actual practices. We examined the current practices of a large sample of Estonian teachers (N = 1258, which constitutes almost 9% of the total Estonian teacher population) in primary and secondary education in 2017. We found that most of the teachers use games on a regular basis. Mainly, they use the games for motivation and alternation, but they also use them to consolidate and teach new skills. While awareness and motivation are high and experimentation on using games is widespread, practices appear fragmentary and not widely sustained. As a result of this study, we suggest the creation of an evidence base and a better integration of social support structures into teacher education. This is the first large-scale study to look into Estonian teacher's actual practices, and although Estonian teachers have relatively high autonomy and technical skills, we believe that these results and further investigations are applicable in other contexts as well."

This challenges educational institutions to develop new teaching activities and materials to address ever emerging needs. To address this, this paper presents an Educational Framework to support educators in developing new teaching activities and study material for Industry 4.0. The model distinguishes itself from other educational design models by combining an iterative approach toward problem-solving, with the concept of authentic task design, as the core elements. Based on 14 pilot cases, it is concluded that educational framework have increased the educational activities in the areas in focus."

In the subsequent three years, the virus spread explosively all over the country. Only one county, the island of Hiiumaa, remained free of the disease. Due to the drastic decrease in the wild boar population in the period of 2015&2018, the number of ASFV-positive cases among wild boar decreased substantially. From the beginning of 2019 to the autumn of 2020, no ASFV-positive wild boar or domestic pigs were detected in Estonia. A new occurrence of ASFV was detected in August 2020, and by the end of 2022, ASFV had been confirmed in seven counties in Estonia. Investigations into proven molecular markers, such as IGR I73R/I329L, MGF505-5R, K145R, O174L, and B602L, were performed with the aim of clarifying whether these cases of ASFV were new entries or remnants of previous epidemics. The sequences from the period of 2014&2022 were compared to the Georgia 2007/1 reference sequence and the variant strains present in Europe. The results indicated that not all the molecular markers of the virus successfully used in other geographical regions were suitable for tracing the spread of ASFV in Estonia. Only the B602L-gene analysis enabled us to place the ASFV isolates spreading in 2020&2022 into two epidemiologically different clusters."

To do this, a cross-sectional survey of Iranian farmers was carried out. To select the samples, a multi-stage random sampling process with a proportional assignment was employed. The research instrument was a researcher-made questionnaire whose validity and reliability were verified using various quantitative and qualitative indicators. The results of the extended TPB using structural equation modeling showed that four variables, namely moral norms of participation in management and conservation (MNPMC), attitude towards participation in management and conservation (APMC), subjective norms towards participation in management and conservation (SNPMC), and self-concept about participation in management and conservation (SCPMC) had positive and significant impacts on intention towards participation in management and conservation (IPMC). The results also revealed that that entering MNPMC and SCPMC into TPB could increase its explanatory power. Also, the fit indicators supported the extended TPB. From a practical point of view, the present study provides justifications and insights for the use of MNPMC, APMC, SNPMC, and SCPMC in policies and programs intended to encourage farmers and local communities to participate in wetlands management and conservation."

The model tests were used to study the wear of tools during cutting of metallic workpiece materials. The primary focus was on the performance and degradation mechanism of tool materials during testing under conditions simulating the FSW process, in particular the welding process temperature. Carbide composites were produced using a common press-and-sinter powder metallurgy technique. The model tests were performed on a universal lathe at the cutting speeds enabling cutting temperatures comparable the temperatures of the FSW of aluminium alloys, stainless steels and pure copper. The wear rate of tools was evaluated as the shortening of the length of the cutting tool nose tip and reaction diffusion tests were performed for better understanding of the diffusion-controlled processes during tool degradation (wear). It was concluded that cermets, in particular TiC-NiMo with 75&80 wt.% TiC, show the highest performance in tests with counterparts from aluminium alloy and austenitic stainless steel. On the other hand, in the model tests with copper workpiece, WC-Co hardmetals, in particular composites with 90&94 wt.% WC, outperform most of TiC-based cermet, including TiC-NiMo. Tools from ceramic-metal composites wear most commonly by mechanisms based on adhesion and diffusion."

Longitudinal data on 1781 individuals from an Estonian rapid-assessment survey on COVID-19 were used. HRQoL was assessed with the EQ-5D-3L in June 2020 (baseline) and in May 2021 (follow-up). The HRQoL index score and its socio-demographic and behavioural variations were analysed using pairedt-tests and Tobit regression modelling. Statistically significant declines in mean EQ-5D index scores were observed for all socio-demographic and behavioural variables considered. Most of these changes were due to increased reporting of problems in the pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression health domains. Older age, being unemployed or economically non-active and having financial difficulties were significantly associated with lower HRQoL in both baseline and follow-up measurements. In the follow-up data, women had significantly lower HRQoL compared to men, whereas higher education proved to be the only protective factor regarding HRQoL. Unhealthy dietary habits and low physical activity had a negative impact on the HRQoL score in the follow-up data. These results indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial impact on HRQoL in the Estonian population."

Forty-four kindergartens across Estonia participated in the study, half of which had a physical education teacher (PEt), whereas the remaining 22 kindergartens were taught by non-qualified kindergarten teachers (NoPEt). Six Eurofit fitness tests were used to assess the physical development of children (n= 704; aged 6&7 years old, with an average age of 6.55 √Ç¬± 0.5 years). An analysis of variance was used to compare the mean values of the fitness test results of the two groups. Linear regression analysis was applied to clarify the influence of individual and environmental factors on children's fitness scores. In kindergartens where the position of a PEt had been created, the results of children's physical fitness were statistically significantly better, more specifically in handgrip strength (m = 12.0, 95% CI = 11.8&12.3 vs. m = 11.5, 95% CI = 11.2&11.7) and in speed tests (m = 23.0, 95% CI = 22.8&23.2 vs. m = 23.6, 95% CI = 23.3&23.8). According to the teacher interviews, these kindergartens also had more rooms and areas specially created for physical exercises. The study revealed that the physical development of children is, when controlling for other individual and environmental factors, influenced by the professional qualification of the PE teacher (95% CI = 0.06&0.56) as well as children's participation in sports training (95% CI = 0.29&0.83). These findings are important for preschool institutions and municipalities in designing the optimal physical environment for facilitating children's physical fitness."

Type 2 diabetes is associated with a higher risk of cognitive impairment, including dementia, which in turn increases the risk of hospitalization, falls, and premature mortality. In this study, we conducted a systematic review to achieve this goal, including searches on electronic databases such as PubMed, Medline, Web of Science, EBSCO Discovery, EBSCO host, Scopus, and ScienceDirect, from 2016 onwards. Additionally, we carried out manual searches in leading journals in the field. After evaluating and analyzing the articles, 60 remained, focusing on the following four main themes: disorders due to biological, psychological, social, and pharmacological causes that lead to neuropsychological complications. Based on the results, consistently analogous risk factors contributing to the onset of cognitive impairments, depression, and psychosocial predicaments encompass comorbid ailments, dysglycemia, gender, heightened levels of apprehension and anxiety, educational attainment, socio-economic standing, and pharmaceutical interventions. Furthermore, in the realm of type 2 diabetes, factors such as disease duration, adiposity, specifically overweight and obesity, and advancing age were also identified as significant contributors to cognitive impairments and depression. Concomitantly, the absence of a robust support system and social network emerged as a shared risk factor, predisposing individuals to psychosocial challenges and depressive states. These findings emphasize that the risk factors for cognitive impairments, depression, and psychosocial issues for type 2 diabetes are similar, highlighting the importance of psychosocial support, education, and patient-centered treatment to optimize outcomes and quality of life."

Decreased CK metabolic flux and downregulation of mitochondrial MTCK1A in breast cancer cells indicate rewiring of phosphotransfer circuits. Discovered overexpression of HK2, AK2, and AK6 isoforms in mitochondrial and nuclear compartments suggests that aggressive cancer cells use a strategy of microcompartmentation to support specific cellular functions and promote tumor growth. This study uncovers new features of cancer cell energetics and provides unique insights into the remodeling of the phosphotransfer enzyme network in breast cancer cells that could be used to facilitate the development of new treatment strategies for TNBC."

A voluminous and dense extracellular matrix of articular cartilage inhibits antibody penetration, and therefore, proteins present at low concentrations and masked during fixation may need antigen retrieval to enhance an IHC outcome. We focused on the IHC detection of a minor but diagnostically promising cartilage glycoprotein, CILP-2 (cartilage intermediate layer protein 2), to demonstrate the effect of four different protocols: (1) heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER), (2) proteolytic-induced epitope retrieval applying proteinase K and hyaluronidase (PIER), (3) HIER combined with PIER, and (4) no antigen retrieval (control). A semi-quantitative staining assessment based on the CILP-2 staining extent was applied. Out of the tested antigen retrieval protocols, the best CILP-2 IHC staining results were achieved by PIER. Combining PIER with HIER did not improve CILP-2 staining in the given experimental setting. Rather the opposite, the application of heat reduced the positive effect of PIER on CILP-2 staining and resulted in the frequent detachment of sections from the slides. Our findings emphasize the need for proper adaptation of antigen retrieval protocols for IHC to maximize the quantitative evaluation of minor matrix proteins in OA articular cartilage samples."

Pelvic anthropometric data and body composition were measured with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Participants performed 30 min cycling at 50% peak power output at constant intensity on a cyclus-2 ergometer. Muscle fatigue during cycling was assessed by surface electromyogram spectral mean power frequency (MPF) for the back, gluteal, and thigh muscles. The pressure mapping system was used to assess sitting symmetry before and after the cycling exercise. At the end of cycling, MPF was decreased (p < 0.05) in the dominant side‚Äôs erector spinae muscle and the contralateral gluteal muscle. After the exercise, a significant (p < 0.05) asymmetry in seat pressure was observed under the ischial tuberosity based on the peak pressure right to left ratio, whereas peak pressure decreased under the left ischial tuberosity. After the exercise, the relationship (p < 0.05) between pelvis width and pressure under the ischial tuberosity occurred on the dominant side of the body. In conclusion, an asymmetry was revealed after the constant-load cycling exercise by peak pressure ratio right to left side. Further studies should address the role of seat pressure asymmetries before and after cycling exercises at different intensities and durations.

Thus, we assessed the effects of flying altitude and lateral and longitudinal overlaps on digital aerial photogrammetry (DAP) processing and the ability of its products to provide point clouds for forestry inventory. For this, we used 18 combinations of flight settings for data acquisition, and a nationwide airborne laser scanning (ALS) dataset as reference data. Linear regression was applied for modeling DAP quality indicators and model fitting quality as the function of flight settings; equivalence tests compared DAP- and ALS-products. Most of DAP-Digital Terrain Models (DTM) showed a moderate to high agreement (R2> 0.70) when fitted to ALS-based models; nine models had a regression slope within the 1% region of equivalence. The best DAP-Canopy Height Model (CHM) was generated using ALS-DTM with an R2= 0.42 when compared with ALS-CHM, indicating reduced similarity. Altogether, our results suggest that the optimal combination of flight settings should include a 90% lateral overlap, a 70% longitudinal overlap, and a minimum altitude of 120 m above ground level, independent of the availability of an ALS-derived DTM for height normalization. We also provided insights into the effects of flight settings on DAP outputs for future applications in similar forest stands, emphasizing the benefits of overlaps for comprehensive scene reconstruction and altitude for canopy surface detection."

To evaluate the above scenarios, a comprehensive energy/exergy analysis was performed, and economic indicators were calculated. The primary energy consumed, as well as the heat and electricity generated, were all taken into account. Based on this analysis, a scenario was selected using multiple-criteria decision-making that will improve energy efficiency and reliability of the system."

How does organizational agency and cultural policy (at national and subnational level) contribute to cultural sustainability in the context of such disruptions? To answer the first question, in 2022 we conducted empirical research among representatives of Estonian community houses. The second question provides historical, political and cultural context to address the first. Estonian community houses, numbering 376 in operation today, are a unique network to study. In the nineteenth century, these cultural hubs became the basis for the system of nonformal life-long education, arts, and culture, and later regulated and developed within the subnational politics of culture and education in the Estonian nation-state, in the Soviet Union and in today's Estonia (1991's Estonia ( -2023) ) as part of the European Union. The Covid-19 pandemic added a new set of disruptions. In this light, the continuity of the functioning of community houses, alongside their ability to adapt, becomes particularly important for both local communities and sustainable cultural development."

A PMM is a process where the observation process and underlying state sequence form a two-dimensional Markov chain, it is a natural generalization of a hidden Markov model. To demonstrate the richness of the class of PMMs, we examine closer a few examples of rather different types of PMMs: a model for two related Markov chains, a model that allows to model an inhomogeneous Markov chain as a conditional marginal process of a homogeneous PMM, and a semi-Markov model. The segmentation problem assumes that one of the marginal processes is observed and the other one is not, the problem is to estimate the unobserved state path given the observations. The standard state path estimators often used are the so-called Viterbi path (a sequence with maximum state path probability given the observations) or the pointwise maximum a posteriori (PMAP) path (a sequence that maximizes the conditional state probability for given observations pointwise). Both these estimators have their limitations, therefore we derive formulas for calculating the so-called hybrid path estimators which interpolate between the PMAP and Viterbi path. We apply the introduced algorithms to the studied models in order to demonstrate the properties of different segmentation methods, and to illustrate large variation in behaviour of different segmentation methods in different PMMs. The studied examples show that a segmentation method should always be chosen with care by taking into account the purpose of modelling and the particular model of interest."

Low PF significantly contributes to the prevalence of obesity in adolescents, with an increased risk of developing chronic diseases. The objectives of the present study were to explore the health-related PF components and body composition levels in adolescents in three European cities, and their differences. The present study is a cross-sectional, descriptive, and quantitative research effort with 1717 participants aged between 13&16 years (48% girls), enrolled in public and private secondary schools in Seville (Spain), Reykjavik (Iceland) and Tartu (Estonia). The ALPHA fitness battery test was used with the following tests: handgrip strength, standing broad jump, 4 √É‚Äî 10 m speed-agility, 20 m shuttle run, and anthropometric variables. Regarding body composition, differences were detected for city and gender in height (p< 0.001), weight (p< 0.001), body fat percentage (p< 0.001), and waist circumference (p< 0.001); but no differences were reported for BMI for both city (p= 0.150) and gender (p= 0.738). Similarly, concerning PF, it was detected statistically significant differences between cities and gender in handgrip strength (p< 0.001), jump test (p< 0.001), speed-agility test (p< 0.001), and cardiovascular endurance in both variables (p< 0.001). In total, 26.8% of the boys and 27.3% of the girls were categorized as overweight; 18.1% of the boys and 31.2% of the girls had an excessive percentage of fat mass; and 22.7% of the boys and 22.2% of the girls showed an excessive waist circumference. The participants from Seville presented the lowest results in PF tests. In contrast, Reykjavik, with the highest results in the endurance and speed-agility tests, and Tartu, with higher results in the manual grip strength and long jump tests, shared the highest results."

However, from the mathematical point of view, these problems belong to the most general branch of non-linear optimization problems, where these tools cannot guarantee that a global minimum is found. The numerical cost and the accuracy of these algorithms depend on the initialization of their internal parameters, which may themselves be the subject of parameter tuning according to the application. In practice, these optimization problems are even more challenging, because engineers are looking for robust designs, which are not sensitive to the tolerances and the manufacturing uncertainties. These criteria further increase these computationally expensive problems due to the additional evaluations of the goal function. The goal of this paper is to give an overview of the widely used optimization techniques in electrical machinery and to summarize the challenges and open problems in the applications of the robust design optimization and the prospects in the case of the newly emerging technologies."

In particular, SHS-derived powders comprise a significant defect concentration in order to effectively enhance the mass transfer processes during the sintering, which allows for the successful consolidation of difficult-to-sinter materials at relatively low sintering temperatures. From this perspective, the design of precursors suitable for sintering, synthesis in a controlled temperature regime and the optimization of geometrical and structural parameters of SHS powders as a potential feedstock for the consolidation is of key importance. Here, we report on the comparative studies concerning the SHS processing of composites for advanced powder metallurgy techniques. The synthesis and sintering peculiarities of the SHS through coupled reactions in the Me'O3(WO3,MoO3)-Me''O(CuO,NiO)-Mg-C, Ti-B-Al12Mg17systems are comparatively reviewed. The SHS coupling approach was used for the preparation of powders with a tuned degree of fineness (a high specific surface area of particles), a high-homogeneity and a controllable distribution of elements via both the regulation of the thermal regime of combustion in a wide range and the matching of the thermal and kinetic requirements of two interconnected reactions. Microstructural features of the powder feedstock greatly contributed to the subsequent consolidation process."

In the present study, in vitro antibacterial effect of the extracts of chokeberry, blackcurrant, and rowan berries and berry pomaces againstL. monocytogenes,S. aureus,E. coli, andC. jejuniwas studied. In addition, the polyphenolic profile and antioxidant activity of these extracts were investigated. The polyphenolic profiles in the aqueous and 30% ethanolic extracts were determined chromatographically by HPLC-MS, and the total polyphenol content was estimated spectrophotometrically by HPLC-DAD-UV. The minimal inhibition concentrations (MICs) of the extracts against tested bacteria were determined by the broth microdilution method. The content of total polyphenols was highest and good antioxidative properties of the extracts were determined for chokeberry and blackcurrant berries and their pomaces. The highest proportions of total quercetin derivatives and anthocyanins were found in the extracts of chokeberry berry/pomace and blackcurrant berry/pomace, respectively. The sensitivity of tested microbes to the extracts of berries and berry pomaces was as follows:S. aureus>L. monocytogenes>E. coliandC. jejuni.In vitro antibacterial activity of tested extracts depended on the extraction solvent, mainly for the ethanolic extracts. Findings suggest that chokeberry and blackcurrant berries and their pomaces can be used as a good source of polyphenols with antioxidative properties, and they also have antibacterial activity against some foodborne pathogenic bacteria. It is important that the valuable compounds are extracted from juice press residues before their disposal."

Thus, systematic studies in simplified model systems are required to pinpoint the choice of targets for further exploration in clinical settings. Here, we report screening of 5 compounds targeting epigenetic writers or erasers and 6 compounds targeting cell cycle-regulating protein kinases against 3 glioblastoma cell lines following incubation under normoxic or hypoxic conditions. The viability/proliferation assay indicated that PRMT5 inhibitor onametostat was endowed with high potency under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions in cell lines that are strongly MGMT-positive (T98-G), weakly MGMT-positive (U-251 MG), or MGMT-negative (U-87 MG). In U-251 MG and U-87 MG cells, onametostat also affected the spheroid formation at concentrations lower than the currently used chemotherapeutic drug lomustine. In T98-G cell line, treatment with onametostat led to dramatic changes in the transcriptome profile by inducing the cell cycle arrest, suppressing RNA splicing, and down-regulating several major glioblastoma cell survival pathways. Further validation by immunostaining in three cell lines confirmed that onametostat affects cell cycle and causes reduction in nucleolar protein levels. In this way, inhibition of epigenetic targets might represent a viable strategy for glioblastoma treatment even in the case of decreased chemo- and radiation sensitivity, although further studies in clinically more relevant models are required."

Problems concerning the options for passively controlling the temperatures of PV panels with PCM and directing excess moisture out of the wall via diffusion channels have been previously studied theoretically. During this study, real wall-scale experiments were conducted to test the thermal and hygrothermal performance of the wall system in an extreme climatic environment, as well as in a real outdoor environment in Tallinn, Estonia. Finally, a simulation model was calibrated according to the measured data. It was found that in case of test walls with diffusion channels, it was possible to keep the moisture content of PCM mortar under 0.11 m3/m3. Excess water drained out via channels leading to the external environment. Without diffusion channels, the moisture content rose as high as 0.18 m3/m3. Both the experiments and hygrothermal modelling showed that the high moisture content of PCM mortar, caused by water leakage, dropped to 0.08 m3/m3over 10 solar cycles as moisture escaped via the diffusion channels. PCM mortar with a moisture content of 0.08 m3/m3endured extreme rain and freeze-thaw cycles without visual damage, and PV panels retained their electrical production capabilities."

This study addresses these issues by integrating comprehensive urban planning with building information modeling (BIM) to create a seamless information flow throughout the building lifecycle. We propose a holistic framework that synchronizes data from planning to demolition, incorporating national and municipal digital twins. An imperative literature review and analysis of international best practices were conducted to develop a conceptual framework aimed at improving data accuracy and interoperability. Our findings underscore the importance of adopting open standards such as Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) and CityGML for effective information exchange. By implementing an information model (IM)-based approach in urban planning and public sector permit processes, project timelines can be streamlined, and regulatory compliance enhanced. This study concludes that continuous, integrated information flow facilitates more efficient, cost-effective construction practices and improved decision-making. Furthermore, this research illustrates the potential of digital twin technology to revolutionize the construction industry by enabling real-time data integration and fostering stakeholder collaboration, ultimately offering a robust framework for practitioners, and significantly enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of construction processes."

During their travel, they collect and transmit information about their movement and their surrounding environment. In this paper, we present and assess a low-cost (<150 EUR) customizable drifter developed with off-the-shelf components. The open drifter is capable of handling the majority of use cases defined in the specialized literature and in addition it offers a general river flow characterization toolkit. One of the main goals of this work is to establish an open hardware and software basis to increase the use of drifters in river studies. Results show that the proposed drifter provides reliable surface velocity estimates when compared to a commercial flow meter, offering a lower cost per data point and in contrast to traditional point measurements it can be used to identify and classify large-scale surface flow patterns. The diverse sensor payload of the open drifter presented in this work makes it a new and unique tool for autonomous river characterization."

The synergies between lean and digital practices were explored by developing solutions in two different case studies, one in the UK and the other in Estonia. Research results were interpreted, and the main lessons learned were articulated. The digital LPS whiteboard enabled and supported the remote planning and control of design projects and processes. The digital LPS whiteboard had the following process-related benefits, including, for example, increased transparency, understanding, engagement, flexibility, and continuous improvement. Challenges in the use of the digital whiteboard were generally due to an excess of information and meetings, the social limitations of virtual meetings, and a lack of relevant IT competencies. Recommendations for individuals interested in planning, developing, and testing a digital whiteboard for remote implementation of the LPS are made. Further research on the entangled nature of digital whiteboard functionality and LPS behaviors is needed."

We also examine how the citizen discussions resonate with scientific environmental priorities and how researchers see the role of citizens in policy processes and harmonising citizen and scientific knowledge. To pursue the citizen voices, an expert working group acting as knowledge brokers, facilitated a series of citizen workshops in seven European locations and a reflective researcher workshop in Belgium. Based on the results, participants identified many concrete and value-related measures to stop environmental degradation. The environmental priorities differed between citizens and scientists, but not irreconcilably; rather, they complemented one another. Both groups stressed environmentally minded attitudes in individuals and policy. Displaying diversity of perspectives was regarded as positive and adding legitimacy. Improving methods for balanced encounters among science and society is central for participation to become more than rhetoric in the EU."

The automatic processing scheme of S1 data was set up for the mapping of open-water flooding (OWF) and flooding under vegetation (FUV). The extremely mild winter of 2019/2020 resulted in several large floods at floodplains that were detected from S1 imagery with a maximal OWF extent up to 5000 ha and maximal FUV extent up to 4500 ha. A significant correlation (r2> 0.6) between the OWF extent and the closest gauge data was obtained for inland riverbank floodplains. The outcome enabled us to define the water level at which the water exceeds the shoreline and flooding starts. However, for a coastal river delta floodplain, a lower correlation (r2< 0.34) with gauge data was obtained, and the excess of river coastline could not be related to a certain water level. At inland riverbank floodplains, the extent of FUV was three times larger compared to that of OWF. The correlation between the water level and FUV was <0.51, indicating that the river water level at these test sites can be used as a proxy for forest floods. Relating conventional gauge data to S1 time series data contributes to flood risk mitigation."

Data quality, however, is a multidimensional concept, where the nature of the data quality issues is very diverse. One of the most widely anticipated data quality challenges, which becomes particularly vital when data come from multiple data sources which is a typical situation in the current data-driven world, is duplicates or non-uniqueness. Even more, duplicates were recognised to be one of the key domain-specific data quality dimensions in the context of the Internet of Things (IoT) application domains, where smart grids and health dominate most. Duplicate data lead to inaccurate analyses, leading to wrong decisions, negatively affect data-driven and/or data processing activities such as the development of models, forecasts, simulations, have a negative impact on customer service, risk and crisis management, service personalisation in terms of both their accuracy and trustworthiness, decrease user adoption and satisfaction, etc. The process of determination and elimination of duplicates is known as deduplication, while the process of finding duplicates in one or more databases that refer to the same entities is known as Record Linkage. To find the duplicates, the data sets are compared with each other using similarity functions that are usually used to compare two input strings to find similarities between them, which requires quadratic time complexity. To defuse the quadratic complexity of the problem, especially in large data sources, record linkage methods, such as blocking and sorted neighbourhood, are used. In this paper, we propose a six-step record linkage deduplication framework. The operation of the framework is demonstrated on a simplified example of research data artifacts, such as publications, research projects and others of the real-world research institution representing Research Information Systems (RIS) domain. To make the proposed framework usable we integrated it into a tool that is already used in practice, by developing a prototype of an extension for the well-known DataCleaner. The framework detects and visualises duplicates thereby identifying and providing the user with identified redundancies in a user-friendly manner allowing their further elimination. By removing the redundancies, the quality of the data is improved therefore improving analyses and decision-making. This study makes a call for other researchers to take a step towards the √¢‚Ç¨≈ìgolden record√¢‚Ç¨¬ù that can be achieved when all data quality issues are recognised and resolved, thus moving towards absolute data quality."

However, only a few university laboratories are focused on district heating aspects. Further, the concept of such laboratories is not adequately disseminated in the scientific literature. The main objective of this paper is to develop a conceptual design of a solar energy laboratory with a focus on district heating systems. The proposed concept forms part of the preliminary study carried out by a research group at the Tallinn University of Technology. First, a brief literature review on solar energy laboratory development is provided. Then, the conceptual design of such a laboratory is presented, along with a case study. Regardless of project size, the main components of a district heating-based solar energy laboratory are solar collectors, thermal energy storage (TES) tanks, and a control system. The proposed laboratory is expected to serve multiple roles, such as a practical laboratory to provide interdisciplinary courses for students, a research and experimental platform for researchers, and a cradle to achieve the campus green initiative. It is roughly estimated that the thermal energy output from the proposed laboratory would meet around 25% of the heat demand of the institutional building during the summer season (May, June, July, and August). It is expected that the present study will be a reference material for the development of innovative energy laboratories in educational institutions."

This is due to different factors that influence the decomposition process. In field conditions, the incorporation of crop residues into soil does not always have a positive effect on aggregate stability. The aim of this study was to investigate the decomposition effects of residues from two different cover crops (Brassica napusvar.oleiferaandSecale cereale) and one main crop (wheat straw) on soil aggregate stability. A 105-day incubation experiment was conducted in which crop residues were mixed with sandy loam soil at a rate of 6 g C kg√¢ÀÜ‚Äô1of soil. During the incubation, there were five water additions. The decomposition effects of organic matter on soil conditions during incubation were evaluated by determining the soil functional groups; carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), and methane (CH4) emissions; soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC); and water-stable aggregates (WSA). The functional groups of the plant residues and the soil were analyzed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and a double exponential model was used to estimate the decomposition rates. The results show that the decomposition rate of fresh organic materials was correlated with the soil functional groups and the C/N ratio. Oilseed rape and rye, with lower C/N ratios than wheat straw residues, had faster decomposition rates and higher CO2and N2O emissions than wheat straw. The CO2and N2O flush at the start of the experiment corresponded to a decrease of soil aggregate stability (from Day 3 to Day 10 for CO2and from Day 19 to Day 28 for N2O emissions), which was linked to higher decomposition rates of the labile fraction. The lower decomposition rates contributed to higher remaining C (carbon) and higher soil aggregate stability. The results also show that changes in the soil functional groups due to crop residue incorporation did not significantly influence aggregate stability. Soil moisture (SM) negatively influenced the aggregate stability and greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) in all treatments (oilseed rape, rye, wheat straw, and control). Irrespective of the water addition procedure, rye and wheat straw residues had a positive effect on water-stable aggregates more frequently than oilseed rape during the incubation period. The results presented here may contribute to a better understanding of decomposition processes after the incorporation of fresh crop residues from cover crops. A future field study investigating the influence of incorporation rates of different crop residues on soil aggregate stability would be of great interest."

However, there are several unanswered questions, such as: Do organic farmers generate higher profits? Will the cost of cultivation reduce to compensate for low yields? Can farmers practice as per the organic agriculture protocols and obtain certification? The literature on organic agriculture varies widely in terms of profitability, yields and costs of organic products. A few studies have researched site-specific organic agriculture, but none have compared organic with conventional agriculture at larger scale in India. The Indian government has promoted organic agriculture since 2015 through its pan-India scheme: Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY). Under this program, there were 13.9 million certified organic farmers in 29,859 organic clusters, covering 0.59 million hectares (about 0.4% of the cropped area in India). This study assessed the implementation process of PKVY and the impact at the farmer level using the Difference-in-Difference approach. An economic surplus model was employed to observe the macro scale using data from an all-India representative sample from 576 clusters for the crop year 2017. The results identified that organic farmers experienced 14&19 percent less costs and 12&18 percent lower yields than conventional farmers. The net result is a marginal increase in profitability compared to traditional agriculture. The economy-wide economic surplus model indicates that there will be a reduction in producer and consumer surplus due to reduced crop yields. However, if the shift from conventional to organic is confined to rainfed, hilly and tribal areas, there will be an increase in both consumer and producer surplus."

Researchers have explored various methods to design NIDSs with improved accuracy, prevention measures, and faster anomaly identification. Safeguarding computer systems by quickly identifying external intruders is crucial for seamless business continuity and data protection. Recently, bioinformatics techniques have been adopted in NIDSs' design, enhancing their capabilities and strengthening network security. Moreover, researchers in computer science have found inspiration in molecular biology's survival mechanisms. These nature-designed mechanisms offer promising solutions for network security challenges, outperforming traditional techniques and leading to better results. Integrating these nature-inspired approaches not only enriches computer science, but also enhances network security by leveraging the wisdom of nature's evolution. As a result, we have proposed a novel Amino-acid-encoding mechanism that is bio-inspired, utilizing essential Amino acids to encode network transactions and generate structural properties from Amino acid sequences. This mechanism offers advantages over other methods in the literature by preserving the original data relationships, achieving high accuracy of up to 99%, transforming original features into a fixed number of numerical features using bio-inspired mechanisms, and employing deep machine learning methods to generate a trained model capable of efficiently detecting network attack transactions in real-time."

This immunome-microbiome relationship influences the innate and adaptive immune responses, thereby affecting the onset and progression of reproductive disorders. However, the mechanisms governing these interactions remain elusive and require innovative approaches to gather more understanding. This comprehensive review examines the current knowledge on reproductive microbiomes across various parts of female reproductive tract, with special consideration of bidirectional interactions between microbiomes and the immune system. Additionally, it explores innate and adaptive immunity, focusing on immunoglobulin (Ig) A and IgM antibodies, their regulation, self-antigen tolerance mechanisms, and their roles in immune homeostasis. This review also highlights ongoing technological innovations in microbiota research, emphasizing the need for standardized detection and analysis methods. For instance, we evaluate the clinical utility of innovative technologies such as Phage ImmunoPrecipitation Sequencing (PhIP-Seq) and Microbial Flow Cytometry coupled to Next-Generation Sequencing (mFLOW-Seq). Despite ongoing advancements, we emphasize the need for further exploration in this field, as a deeper understanding of immunome-microbiome interactions holds promise for innovative diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for reproductive health, like infertility treatment and management of pregnancy."

A close-form formulation and a transfer function methodology are introduced, integrating control system theory with metastructure analysis, offering new insights into the role of internal coupling. The findings reveal that precise internal coupling, when matched exactly to the stiffness of the resonator, enables the clear formation of secondary bandgaps, significantly influencing the vibration isolation efficacy of the metastructure. Although the study primarily focuses on theoretical and numerical analyses, the implications of adjusting mass distribution on resonators are also explored. This formulation methodology enables the adjustment of bandgap characteristics, underscoring the potential for adaptive control over bandgaps in metastructures. Such capabilities are crucial for tailoring the vibration isolation and energy harvesting functionalities in mechanically resonant systems, especially when applied to demanding heavy-duty applications."

Subsequently, it rapidly expanded its presence to encompass a significant portion of the Kharkiv region and the parks of Kyiv. Previous research has established that the climatic conditions in Luhansk and its neighboring regions are conducive to the EAB, and the absence of a host plant (Fraxinussp.) does not act as a deterrent to the pest's expansion in Ukraine. Recognizing the urgency of identifying infested trees, our current research aimed to identify the most attractive EAB forest subcompartments based on forest site conditions and stand structure. Utilizing the MaxEnt model, we achieved an average performance in predicting the potential distribution of the EAB (AUC = 0.842).

The physical load in military service, especially in the first stage, is significantly greater than for men in everyday life. Therefore, it is important to know if health promotion in civilian life adequately prepares young people for military service and to what extent pre-military health behaviors affect physical performance during service. The purpose of this work was to examine conscripts' physical fitness at different stages of military service and its relationships with previous lifestyle. Soldiers' physical fitness was estimated three times during military service using three tests: sit-ups, push-ups and 2-mile run. Lifestyle and socio-economic background data was collected by a web-based questionnaire (n = 235). Linear regression analysis was performed using Army Physical Fitness Test (APFT) scores as dependent variables and questionnaire data as independent variables. The socio-economic background variables had no effect on physical fitness scores throughout the training period (p> 0.05). Young men that were physically more active daily, did sports, had healthier diet and did not smoke before entering military service showed better physical fitness test results throughout the period of service (p< 0.05). The effect of participation in sports was evident, as the conscripts with previous sports experiences demonstrated higher fitness tests scores (p< 0.01). These findings show that health promotion initiatives or programs for promoting physical activity and healthy diet, and preventing obesity and tobacco use, can also have a positive effect on the physical performance of young men during military service."

The myth of Adapa in Akkadian offers a version of the narrative in which the sage was promoted in heaven to a god-like status, which concept is corroborated with an entry in the cuneiform compendiumTintirand theChronicle of the Esagila. This tradition also associated Adapa with the immortalized flood survivor. In the form of a counter narrative, the Enochic texts of Judaism attributed the heavenly assumption to Enoch and presented the Watchers as the demonic entities subordinated to him. The fall of the Watchers, the promotion of Enoch, and the primordial battle against evil forces are depicted in the Animal Apocalypse of1 Enoch85&90. A very similar scenario is found in theChronicle of Esagila, which describes the early history of humankind from the Babylonian perspective. It can be demonstrated that the Animal Apocalypse uses this or a similar cuneiform historiographic source as the basis of its counter narrative."

Two different radiometric systems, TriOS-Radiation Measurement Sensor with Enhanced Spectral resolution (RAMSES) and Seabird-Hyperspectral Surface Acquisition System (HyperSAS), were compared and operated side-by-side over a wide range of Atlantic provinces and environmental conditions. Both systems were calibrated for traceability to SI (Syst√É¬®me international) units at the same optical laboratory under uniform conditions before and after the field campaign. The in situ results and their accompanying uncertainties were evaluated using the same data handling protocols. The field data revealed variability in the responsivity between TRiOS and Seabird sensors, which is dependent on the ambient environmental and illumination conditions. The straylight effects for individual sensors were mostly within √Ç¬±3%. A near infra-red (NIR) similarity correction changed the water-leaving reflectance (√è¬Åw) and water-leaving radiance (Lw) spectra significantly, bringing also a convergence in outliers. For improving the estimates of in situ uncertainty, it is recommended that additional characterization of radiometers and environmental ancillary measurements are undertaken. In general, the comparison of radiometric systems showed agreement within the evaluated uncertainty limits. Consistency of in situ results with the available Sentinel-3A Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) data in the range from (400√¢‚Ç¨¬¶560) nm was also satisfactory (√¢ÀÜ‚Äô8% < Mean Percentage Difference (MPD) < 15%) and showed good agreement in terms of the shape of the spectra and absolute values."

Good objects are the fitting targets of positive attitudes, while bad objects are the fitting targets of negative attitudes. The following paper presents an argument to the effect that value and the fittingness of attitudes differ in terms of their explanations. Whereas the fittingness of attitudes is explained, inter alia, by both the properties of attitudes and those of their fitting targets, the explanation of value tends to have a different content. In particular, objects have value in virtue of the features that make them valuable, and these need not involve any attitudinal properties. If this is right, then there are reasons to doubt the claim that for objects to have value is just for them to be the fitting targets of attitudes. Insofar as value is a property, it appears to be distinct from the property of objects being the fitting targets of attitudes."

To explore the reasons for these phenomena, the conduct of different categories of learners is examined and compared in terms of individual engagement and success in education. It is found that the student-centered approach is not necessarily the best method of teaching and learning when applied to students with great differentiation. A number of other conditions are required for success, namely, working in small groups, drawing on learner's abilities, individual instruction methods, etc. These conditions are analyzed in detail in this study.

D√Ö¬çgen belongs to a pansemioticist tradition and indeed maintains that being is tantamount to signification, but unlike previous pansemioticists, such as K√Ö¬´kai, he does not posit a signifying subjective Other to whom the √¢‚Ç¨≈ìmessage√¢‚Ç¨¬ù of reality can be attributed. In D√Ö¬çgen's view, the meaningfulness of an event is a concomitant characteristic of its very reality, because the availability of reality for us to experience is already a linguistic phenomenon. The article argues that this is not a mystical thesis, but a view that can also be articulated in a more familiar and fully rational idiom, and that it bears similarities with many different Western thinkers and theorists, such as Wittgenstein, Heidegger, Gadamer, Peirce, Jakobson, and others."

The negative anomaly, however, decreases smoothly while moving from south to north. Most of the crater rim exhibits anomalous positive values. Negative anomalies at the rim are seen in the south&southwestern sections and coinciding in the northeastern section with the Dhar valley. Our study shows that most of the anomaly is caused by the topographic effect and a strong SE directed natural remanent magnetization of Deccan Trap basalts, which are the target of the Lonar-creating projectile. The magnetic anomaly of the relatively weakly magnetized impact-produced allochthonous breccia and post-impact sediments is small, being less than 150 nT."

However, the bones of this animal have been found on many Stone Age archaeological sites dating from the period 4000&2000 BC along the coasts of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, which shows that it was frequently being hunted by the coastal communities of that time. In this period, the Baltic Sea was saltier than it is today, making conditions more favorable for marine species such as the porpoise. In addition to meat and blubber, the porpoise also provided a tool for decorating pottery vessels made by the Stone Age inhabitants. This instrument was made from the animal's jaw bone, the teeth being impressed in the clay to produce a distinctive row of marks. Such decoration on pottery may have symbolized the coastal way of life and joint hunting activities. Pottery with porpoise tooth ornamentation has been found on many coastal Stone Age sites in the region and also in smaller amounts at inland sites, providing evidence of contact between coastal and inland communities."

The hardfacings were tested under abrasive (low and medium stress) and erosive (high stress) conditions. In elevated temperature erosive conditions, coatings without heat treatment have up to two times higher wear resistance than reference material. Under low-stress conditions, coatings with the finest reinforcing particle size (180&355 √Ç¬µm) treated with local remelting demonstrated more than 10 times higher wear resistance than reference material. The optimal reinforcement size selection depends on the application conditions (low, average, or high stress). In most test conditions, the local remelting did not provide additional improvement.

Fluxes' prediction accuracy greatly relates to the deepness of the MM curation for a specific organism starting from the cell composition. One component is the cell wall, which is a functional barrier (cell shape, exchanges) with the environment. The bacterial cell wall (BCW), including its thickness, structure, and composition, has been extensively studied inEscherichia colibut poorly described for other organisms. The peptidoglycan (PG) layer composing the BCW is usually thinner in Gram√¢ÀÜ‚Äô bacteria than in Gram+ bacteria. In both bacteria groups, PG is a polymeric mesh-like structure of amino acids and sugars, including N-acetylglucosamine, N-acetylmuramic acid, and amino acids. In this study, we propose a high-throughput method to characterise and quantify PG in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria using acidic hydrolysis and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (HILIC-MS). The method showed a relatively short time frame (11 min analytical run), low inter- and intraday variability (3.2% and 4%, respectively), and high sensitivity and selectivity (limits of quantification in the sub mg/L range). The method was successfully applied on two Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coliK12 MG1655,Bacteroides thetaiotaomicronDSM 2079) and one Gram-positive bacterium (Streptococcus salivariusssp.thermophilusDSM20259). The PG concentration ranged from 1.6%w/wto 14%w/wof the dry cell weight. The results were in good correlation with previously published results. With further development, the PG concentration provided by this newly developed method could reinforce the curation of MM."

The case includes an anthropological study of the remains, examinations of documents found with the exhumed remains, and kinship estimations based on archival documents, and DNA analyses. As the preliminary data pointed to remains of male origin, Y-chromosomal STR (short tandem repeat) analyses of 22 Y-STR loci were used to analyze the exhumed teeth. Reference samples from individuals from two paternal lineages were collected based on archival documents. Y-chromosomal STR results for the tooth samples were consistent with a patrilineal relationship to only one reference sample out of two proposed paternal lineages. Based on the provided pedigrees in the consistent case, the Y-STR results are approximately four million times more likely if the tooth sample originated from an individual related along the paternal line to the matching reference sample, than if the tooth sample originated from another person in the general population. Special considerations have to be met when limited evidence is available."

In the tourism sector, rapid developments are particularly taking place around novel uses of mobile positioning data, web scraping, and open application programming interface (API) data, data on sharing, and collaborative economy and passenger data. Based on feedback from 15 European cultural tourism regions, recommendations are developed regarding the use of innovative tools and data sources in tourism management. In terms of potential analytical depth, it is especially advisable to explore the use of mobile positioning data. Yet, there are considerable barriers, especially in terms of privacy protection and ethics, in using such data. User-generated big data from social media, web searches, and website visits constitute another promising data source as it is often publicly available in real time and has low usage barriers.

There is currently limited information about incidence and severity of Alternaria black spot disease (Alternaria brassicae) on the main oilseed crop, spring oilseed rape (Brassica napus), in the Northern Baltics. Thus, spring oilseed rape and five alternative cruciferous oilseed crops were selected and their resistance to black spot disease was evaluated in field conditions during two growing seasons. We hypothesized that spring oilseed rape is more susceptible to Alternaria black spot disease than other alternative cruciferous oilseed crops. Both growing seasons were warmer and drier compared to the long-term average, and were thus suitable forA. brassicaedevelopment and assessments. In both years, incidence of Alternaria black spot infection was recorded on all cruciferous species, yet the disease development differed considerably among the crops. During both growing seasons, black mustard (B. nigra) plants were the most infected. Based on our observations during warm growing seasons we conclude that alternative oilseed crops such asSinapis alba,Eruca sativaandRaphanus sativusare more resistant to the Alternaria black spot infection than the traditional oilseed crops and thus, possess a great potential to grow with limited chemical disease control in Northern Baltic conditions."

The IL 4-PyC8-gemini interactions were studied using DLS, FTIR and NMR spectroscopic techniques. The hydrodynamic diameter of the gemini aggregates in the presence of promethazine (PMZ) as a potential chiral pollutant and the IL 4-PyC8 underwent a transition when the drug was added, from large aggregates (270 nm) to small micelles, which supported the gemini:IL 4-PyC8:promethazine interaction. The structural transitions in the presence of promethazine may be used for designing systems that are responsive to changes in size and shape of the aggregates as an analytical signal for selective detection and binding pollutants."

Support structures are critical in stabilizing excavation pits, with a primary focus on enhancing their bearing capacity. This paper employs finite element modeling techniques to conduct a numerical analysis of nails and helical anchors' bearing capacity. To reinforce the stability of pit walls, selecting an appropriate method for guard structure construction is imperative. The chosen method should efficiently redistribute forces induced by soil mass weight, displacements, and potential loads in the pit vicinity to the ground. Various techniques, including trusses, piles, cross-bracing systems, nailing, and anchorage systems, are utilized for this purpose. The study evaluates numerical models for two guard structure configurations: nailing systems and helical anchorage. It examines the impact of parameters such as displacement, helical helix count, helix diameter variations, and the integration of nailing systems with helices. Comparative analyses are conducted, including displacement comparisons between different nailing systems and helical anchor systems, along with laboratory-sampled data. The research yields significant insights, with a notable finding highlighting the superior performance of helical bracings compared to nailing systems. The conclusions drawn from this study provide specific outcomes that contribute valuable knowledge to the field of deep excavation support structures, guiding future design and implementation practices."

We show that inactivation of Phi6 in solutions with Ag and Cu ions can be as effective as inactivation by pH, temperature, or UV. Adding powder to Ag and Cu ion solutions decreased their virucidal effect. The newly fabricated ceramic and metal surfaces showed very good virucidal activity. In particular, 45%TiO2+ 5%Ag + 45%ZrO2+ 5%Cu, in addition to virus adhesion, showed virucidal and infiltration properties.

A marked improvement in thin-film deposition methods, enabling the precise coating of surfaces at the nanoscale on complex nanostructure and on large surfaces is viable. These include new deposition methods like atomic layer deposition (ALD) that enables the coating on complex nanostructures with high conformality and homogeneity. Other more conventional methods based on coating in solution have also been improved in order to achieve a high quality conformal coating. These deposition processes also enable the synthesis of multilayers and the development of synergistic effects through the mutual interaction of such layers. At the same time, a need for new tools to characterize these films has emerged. This Special Issue is dedicated to these recent developments and contains 10 manuscripts reporting thin-film deposition and coating and their characterization. It compiles works on vapor-phase deposition processes including atomic-layer deposition (ALD) [1,2], mist-chemical-vapor deposition [3] and atmospheric-pressure chemical-vapor deposition (APCVD) [4] methods in which authors have studied the stabilization of metastable phases and the effect of growth conditions on thin film quality, epitaxy, and crystallinity.

For the analyses, we used the example of Tallinn, a middle-sized European capital city acknowledged in innovation reports as a good example of a Smart City development. This is a qualitative case study with data based on the Tallinn 2035 strategy document and on the interviews conducted with city officials. We mapped the current situation in regard to the four Smart City strategies dichotomies framework in order to understand if and how the future vision of Tallinn differs from the present. The results indicate that the current direction deviates in several ways from the future vision set in the strategy, and that to be able to move towards the vision, strategic changes are needed. With this paper we hope to add some insights to the literature about the knowledge gap between Smart City theory and implementation from the perspective of a present situation versus long-term strategy."

There is limited research on the passengers' perception of security and safety of automated mobility, whereas prior research is mostly based on surveys interested in attitudes towards self-driving vehicles, without being linked to the experience. We, on the other hand, are interested in passengers' feeling of security and safety, after taking a ride with an automated shuttle in an open urban environment. For studying this, we conducted an automated shuttle bus last-mile pilot during a four-month period in the city of Tallinn in late 2019. The method is a case study focusing on one city with several tools for data collection applied (surveys, interviews, document analysis). The pilot, open and free for everybody, attracted approximately 4000 passengers, out of which 4% responded to the online feedback survey. For studying the operational capacity, we had a panel interview with operators of the shuttle service, in addition to analyzing daily operational log files. The results indicate that passengers' perceived feeling of security and safety onboard was remarkably high, after taking a ride (and lower without a ride, in a different control group). The bus was operated only if operational capacity was secured, thus having significant downtime in service due to environment, technology and traffic-related factors."

The ratio of the two chemotypes was previously shown to be close to 1:1 at three sites in Southern Germany, which might not be representative given the Palearctic distribution of the species. To infer the frequency of the two chemotypes across the entire distributional range of the species, we analyzed with GC&MS the CHC profile of 1042 dry-mounted specimens stored in private and museum collections. We complemented our sampling by including 324 samples collected and preserved specifically for studying their CHCs. We were capable of reliably identifying the chemotypes in 91% of dry-mounted samples, some of which collected almost 200√Ç¬†years ago. We found both chemotypes to occur in the Far East, the presumed glacial refuge of the species, and their frequency to differ considerably between sites and geographic regions. The geographic structure in the chemotype frequencies could be the result of differential selection regimes and/or different dispersal routes during the colonization of the Western Palearctic. The presented data pave the route for disentangling these factors by providing information where to geographically sampleO. spinipesfor population genetic analyses. They also form the much-needed basis for future studies aiming to understand the evolutionary and geographic origin as well as the genetics of the astounding CHC√Ç¬†profile dimorphism thatO. spinipesfemales exhibit."

We demonstrate that within a strong coupling expansion the single-band Hubbard model shows an instability towards phase separation and extend the approach also for an analysis of phase separation in the Hubbard-Kanamori hamiltonian as a prototypical multiband model. We study the pairing fluctuations on top of an inhomogeneous stripe state where superconducting correlations in the extendeds-wave andd-wave channels correspond to (anti)bound states in the two-particle spectra. Whereas extendeds-wave fluctuations are relevant on the scale of the local interaction parameterU, we find thatd-wave fluctuations are pronounced in the energy range of the active subband which crosses the Fermi level. As a result, low energy spin and charge fluctuations can transfer thed-wave correlations from the bound states to the low energy quasiparticle bands. Our investigations therefore help to understand the coexistence of stripe correlations andd-wave superconductivity in cuprates."

It is preferable that such monitoring is non-invasive and in real time via an affordable, compact and small-scale device for maximum convenience. Numerous literature sources have exploited derivations of these parameters from photoplethysmogram (PPG) and electrical bioimpedance (EBI) signal measurements through the use of calculation algorithms of varying complexity. Compared to electrocardiogram (ECG), these measurement techniques have a merit of well-established practices of designing a wearable device that could conveniently be put on a wrist. The current paper provides a comprehensive review on the use of PPG and EBI measurement techniques in the context of hemodynamic parameter monitoring using a wearable device. A special emphasis is placed on the most basic hemodynamic parameter: heart rate: describing different algorithms of heart rate detection and monitoring.

The experimental study also included ozonation as compared to PCD in energy efficiency. The advantageous energy efficiency of PCD was observed in wide spans of pH and DXM initial concentrations surpassing ozonation by about 2.4 times.

Improved data-analytical tools are needed to exploit all information from these biological datasets, taking into account the peculiarities of microbiome data, i.e., compositional, heterogeneous and sparse nature of these datasets. The possibility of predicting host-phenotypes based on taxonomy-informed feature selection to establish an association between microbiome and predict disease states is beneficial for personalized medicine. In this regard, machine learning (ML) provides new insights into the development of models that can be used to predict outputs, such as classification and prediction in microbiology, infer host phenotypes to predict diseases and use microbial communities to stratify patients by their characterization of state-specific microbial signatures. Here we review the state-of-the-art ML methods and respective software applied in human microbiome studies, performed as part of the COST Action ML4Microbiome activities. This scoping review focuses on the application of ML in microbiome studies related to association and clinical use for diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutics. Although the data presented here is more related to the bacterial community, many algorithms could be applied in general, regardless of the feature type.

OPTRAM is based on the response of short-wave infrared (SWIR) reflectance to vegetation water status, which in turn responds to changes of root-zone soil moisture. In peatlands, the latter is tightly coupled to water table depth (WTD). Therefore, in theory, the OPTRAM index might be a useful tool to monitor WTD dynamics in peatlands, although the sensitivity of OPTRAM index to WTD changes will likely depend on vegetation cover and related rooting depth. In this study, we aim at identifying those locations (further called √¢‚Ç¨Àúbest pixels') where the OPTRAM index is most representative of overall peatland WTD dynamics. In peatlands, the high saturated hydraulic conductivity of the upper layer largely synchronizes the temporal WTD fluctuations over several kilometers, i.e., even though the mean and amplitude of the WTD dynamics may vary in space. Therefore, it can be assumed that the WTD time series, either measured at a single location or simulated for a grid cell with the PEATland-specific adaptation of the NASA Catchment Land Surface Model (PEATCLSM), are representative of the overall peatland WTD dynamics. We took advantage of this concept to identify the √¢‚Ç¨Àúbest pixel' of all spatially distributed OPTRAM pixels within a peatland, as that pixel with the highest time series Pearson correlation (R) with WTD data accounting for temporal autocorrelation. The OPTRAM index was calculated based on various remotely sensed images, namely, Landsat, MODIS, and aggregated Landsat images at MODIS resolution for five northern peatlands with long-term WTD records, including both bogs and fens. The √¢‚Ç¨Àúbest pixels' were dominantly covered with mosses and graminoids with little or no shrub or trees. However, the performance of OPTRAM highly depended on the spatial resolution of the remotely sensed data. The Landsat-based OPTRAM index yielded the highest R values (mean of 0.7 across the √¢‚Ç¨Àúbest pixels' in five peatlands). Our study further indicates that, in the absence of historical in situ data, PEATCLSM can be used as an alternative to localize √¢‚Ç¨Àúbest pixels'. This finding enables the future applicability of OPTRAM to monitor WTD changes in peatlands on a global scale."

Exploring the origins of stromatolites that contain manganese may be a key to deciphering the sedimentary environments and metallogenic processes of these deposits. However, only a few manganese stromatolites have been discovered and described until now. Microbialites are well developed in the manganese deposits, located near the top of the Ediacaran Doushantuo Formation in Chengkou area of Chongqing, northern Yangtze Craton, but has not been explicitly studied; and whether they are true stromatolites orEpiphytonmicrobialites remains controversial. Based on field and core observations and thin section microscopy, the characteristics of five types of manganese stromatolites and their growth modes are described in detail in this study. The results show that these stromatolites grew in a biostrome in shoal and lagoon environments and were syngenetic with oncolites and oolites on a carbonate ramp behind the shoal. Manganese stromatolites can be categorized into three forms: (1) stratiform; (2) columnar, which includes branched and columnar types; and (3) stratiform-columnar, which is a transitional type. Based on a criterion that the diameter is less than or greater than 1√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞mm, columnar stromatolites are further divided into micro-columnar (<√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞1√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞mm) and columnar (>√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞1√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞mm) columns, which display synchronous growth and are similar to Pseudogymnosolenaceae. Their shapes are mainly controlled by water depths and hydrodynamic strengths. The greater the water depth, the more columnar the columns tend to be. Excessively strong hydrodynamic conditions decrease the growth rate of stromatolites, and they even stopped growth due to wave damage. Furthermore, pillared laminar textures (notEpiphyton), which consist of dendritic, micro-branched and micro-columnar stromatolites, are a common feature of the larger stratiform, stratiform-columnar and columnar stromatolites. The alternations of laminae with different internal textures record subtle fluctuations in water depths and hydrodynamic strengths, which indicate that stromatolite growth is controlled by tidal cycles at the lamina level. Therefore, it is possible that the vertical evolution of the stromatolites could reveal the changing characteristics of both local and regional sedimentary environments, i.e., stromatolite shape changes from columnar to stratiform can represent the onset of shallower environments with weak hydrodynamic conditions. In addition, as important reef builders in shallow carbonate ramps, microstromatolites accelerate the development from ramp to platform. Indicators of microbial control on stromatolite shapes and manganese sedimentation processes include the fabric of stromatolite laminae, organic rhodochrosite with a micritic texture that is usually clotted, spherical, tubular, fibrous or dendritic, which suggests that the laminae resulted from microbially induced in situ precipitation."

We explain this controversy through a triad of concepts: sovereignty, governmentality, and post-liberalism: that we apply to an analysis of a corona-imposed state of emergency in Estonia and Finland. Based on comparative case study research, we posit that sovereignty is precarious in post-liberalism due to its large dependence on the technologies of responsibilization and agency. From a biopolitical perspective, a major point in the anti-crisis management is to convince people to sacrifice personal liberties for the sake of public safety. These issues of governmentality will be dealt with based on critical discourse analysis and media analysis in Estonia and Finland."

These converters provide input voltage regulation at fixed switching frequency and good power density. Different modulation methods at the fixed switching frequency enable the implementation of the voltage buck functionality in these converters. The SRC under study is considered as a step-up front-end DC&DC converter for the integration of renewable energy sources in DC microgrids. The paper evaluates the voltage buck performance of the SRC achieved by using different pulse-width modulation (PWM) methods including conventional PWM and shifted PWM. Moreover, the new PWM methods, i.e., the hybrid shifted PWM (HSPWM), improved shifted PWM (ISPWM), and hybrid PWM (HPWM), are proposed to overcome the disadvantages of the existing methods. They improve the power conversion efficiency in the buck mode by reducing the power losses in the semiconductor switches and the isolating transformer of the SRC. The proposed and the existing methods are benchmarked in terms of the components stresses and power conversion efficiency. The presented findings have been experimentally validated by the help of a 200 W prototype, which demonstrated the lowest power loss in the case of the HPWM."

To determine in which applications the use of PMFSM is promising, it is essential to compare the PMFSM with machines of other types. This study provides a theoretical comparison of the PMFSM with a conventional interior permanent magnet synchronous machine (IPMSM) in the gearless generator of a low-power wind turbine (332 rpm, 51.4 Nm). To provide a fair comparison, both machines are optimized using the Nelder&Mead algorithm. The minimized optimization objectives are the required power of frequency converter, cost of active materials, torque ripple and losses of a generator averaged over the working profile of the wind turbine. In order to reduce the computational time, the substituting profile method is applied. Based on the results of the calculations, the advantages and disadvantages of the considered machines were revealed: the IPMSM has significantly lower losses and higher efficiency than the PMFSM, and the PMFSM requires much less rare-earth magnets and copper and is, therefore, cheaper in mass production."

The statistical population included 5473 wheat farmers in Bukan Township, Iran. Krejcie and Morgan tables were used to calculate the sample size of 357 people. All these farmers have key information about the effects of climate change (e.g., drought) and are pioneers in using adaptation and water conservation strategies in wheat production. In this study, the sample size was determined using stratified sampling method with proportional assignment. The questionnaire validity was approved by the validity expert board.

According to the results, economic, institutional, natural, attitudinal, social, and self-identity factors had a significant relationship with WBC at 1% error level. The regression results also showed that among the studied variables, economic and extensional factors had the greatest impact on wheat growers' WCBs. The results can help managers and planners determine policies that focus more on economic and extensional factors that have been neglected in previous studies."

This research explores the properties of TMTHSI-based compounds via three aspects: (1) large-scale production, (2) unique stability in acidic conditions and its subsequent use in peptide synthesis, and (3) the functionalization of antibodies. Here, it is shown that (1) scale-up is achieved on a scale of up to 100 g. (2) TMTHSI is remarkably stable against TFA allowing for the site-specific functionalization of peptides on resin. Finally, (3) the functionalization of an antibody with a model payload is very efficient, with antibody conjugation demonstrating more beneficial features such as a high yield and limited hydrophobicity as compared to other alkyne reagent conjugates. These results illustrate the high potential of TMTHSI for diverse bioconjugation applications, with production already being GMP-compatible and a highly efficient conversion resulting in attractive costs of goods."

Belt type basalt fibers bearing a specific adhesion promoting silane sizing were aligned between veneer sheets with 20 mm spacing and were pretensioned at 150 N. Three-layer plywood samples were prepared and tested for tensile strength at room temperature and at 150 √Ç¬∞C. The room temperature tensile tests revealed a 35% increase in tensile strength for prestressed plywood compared to that of the conventional specimen. The reinforcement effect deteriorated at 150 √Ç¬∞C but was restored upon cooling to room temperature. The deterioration is attributed to the weakening of bonding between the basalt fibers and phenolic resin matrix at elevated temperatures due to the softening of the resin."

One of the most dangerous foliar pathogens of pine isDothistroma septosporum, which is a widely spread threat to northern European forests. We sampled twoPinus sylvestrissites in Estonia and two in Norway in order to analyse the relations between the abundance ofD. septosporumand overall fungal richness, specific fungal species composition, time of season, needle age and position in the canopy. In both countries, the overall species richness of fungi was highest in autumn, showing a trend of increase with needle age. The overall species richness in the second-year needles in Estonia and third-year needles in Norway was similar, suggesting that a critical colonization threshold for needle shed inP. sylvestrisis breached earlier in Estonia than in Norway. The fungal species richness inP. sylvestrisneedles was largely affected byLophodermium conigenum. Especially in older needles, the relative abundance ofL. conigenumwas significantly higher in spring compared to summer or autumn. The timing of recruitment and colonization mechanisms of different foliage endophytes are shortly discussed."

Such attraction has been fostered by the biological roles of EVs, as they carry biomolecules from any cell type to trigger systemic paracrine signaling or to dispose metabolism products. To fulfill their roles, EVs are transported through circulating biofluids, which can be exploited for the administration of therapeutic nanostructures or collected to intercept relevant EV-contained biomarkers. Despite their potential, EVs are ubiquitous and considerably heterogeneous. Therefore, it is fundamental to profile and identify subpopulations of interest. In this study, we optimized EV-labeling protocols on two different high-resolution single-particle platforms, the NanoFCM NanoAnalyzer (nFCM) and Particle Metrix ZetaView Fluorescence Nanoparticle Tracking Analyzer (F-NTA). In addition to the information obtained by particles' scattered light, purified and non-purified EVs from different cell sources were fluorescently stained with combinations of specific dyes and antibodies to facilitate their identification and characterization. Despite the validity and compatibility of EV-labeling strategies, they should be optimized for each platform. Since EVs can be easily confounded with similar-sized nanoparticles, it is imperative to control instrument settings and the specificity of staining protocols in order to conduct a rigorous and informative analysis."

BRCT-bearing proteins are found in Archaea, Bacteria, Eukarya, and viruses. They are traditionally involved in DNA repair, recombination, and cell cycle control. To carry out these functions, BRCT domains are able to interact with DNA and proteins. Moreover, such domains are also implicated in several pathogenic processes and malignancies including breast, ovarian, and lung cancer. Although these domains exhibit moderately conserved folding, their sequences show very low conservation. Interestingly, sequence variations among species are considered positive traits in the search for suitable therapeutic targets, since non-specific drug interactions might be reduced. These main characteristics of BRCT, as well as its critical implications in key biological processes in the cell, have prompted the study of these domains as therapeutic targets. This review explores the possible roles of BRCT domains as therapeutic targets for drug discovery. We describe their common structural features and relevant interactions and pathways, as well as their implications in pathologic processes. Drugs commonly used to target these domains are also presented. Finally, based on their structures, we describe new drug design possibilities using modern and innovative techniques."

This article presents an extensive investigation into the seismic behavior of such diaphragm walls through advanced two-dimensional (2D) numerical modeling. The primary objective is to establish the accuracy and reliability of the numerical model by comparing its results with a reference case history from Tianjin, China. Following successful validation, the study employs rigorous two-dimensional (2D) numerical analyses to examine the response of the diaphragm wall to seismic events while considering crucial factors. These factors encompass the dynamics of pore water pressure, the diverse acceleration histories of earthquakes, varying tunnel positions, and their combined influence on the horizontal displacement of the wall. From our findings, we can conclude that earthquake duration has a more substantial impact on displacement and wall deformation compared to peak ground acceleration (PGA). Longer earthquake durations are associated with greater displacement. In dynamic analyses, the presence of water diminishes soil displacement and concentrates plastic deformation points. The distance between the tunnel and the diaphragm wall significantly affects wall displacement and deformation. The effective distance is approximately 10 m. Our findings can inform better design and construction practices to enhance the stability of underground infrastructure in seismically active regions."

It was hypothesized that the addition of formate and folate would have a stimulating effect on anammox bacteria, which in turn would lead to the stability of the anammox process under conditions of a sharp increase in ammonium load, i.e., it helps overcome a stress factor. The effect of formate and folate was investigated using a setup consisting of three parallel sequencing batch reactors equipped with a carrier. Two runs of the reactors were performed. The composition of the microbial community was studied by the 16S rRNA gene profiling and metagenomic analysis. Among anammox bacteria,Ca.√¢‚Ç¨≈ìBrocadia√¢‚Ç¨¬ù spp. dominated during the first run. A stimulatory effect of folate on the daily nitrogen removal rate (dN) was identified. The addition of formate led to progress in dissimilatory nitrate reduction and stimulated the growth ofCa.√¢‚Ç¨≈ìJettenia√¢‚Ç¨¬ù spp. The spatial separation of two anammox species was observed in the formate reactor:Ca.√¢‚Ç¨≈ìBrocadia√¢‚Ç¨¬ù occupied the carrier andCa.√¢‚Ç¨≈ìJettenia√¢‚Ç¨¬ù: the walls of the reactors.

However, due to limited ground truth data, the product quality has not yet been analyzed in detail with the fiducial reference measurement (FRM) dataset. Here, we use the fully characterized ground truth FRM dataset for validating Sentinel-3A Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) radiometric products over optically complex Estonian inland waters and Baltic Sea coastal areas. As consistency between satellite and local data depends on uncertainty in field measurements, filtering of the in situ data has been made based on the uncertainty for the final comparison. We have compared various atmospheric correction methods and found POLYMER (POLYnomial-based algorithm applied to MERIS) to be most suitable for optically complex waters under study in terms of product accuracy, amount of usable data and also being least influenced by the adjacency effect."

In this work, the bridgeless rectifier, which is utilized intensively in the applications of the power factor correction, has been integrated into the SRC as a voltage step-up cell at the output-side of the SRC. It is shown that the conventional overlapping pulse-width modulation (PWM) of the two metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors MOSFETs in this rectification cell limits the input voltage regulation range of the converter due to excessive power losses in abnormal operating conditions. The abnormal operating conditions occur when the instantaneous voltage across the resonant capacitor is larger than the secondary voltage of the isolation transformer. This happens at high values of the DC voltage gain, i.e., low input voltages and high currents, which causes the resonant current to flow in the reverse direction in the same half-cycle through a parasitic path formed by overlapping PWM of the rectifier MOSFETs. The abnormal operation results in additional conduction loss in the converter as the MOSFETs of the bridgeless boost rectifier turn on at high current at the beginning of each half of the switching period. Accordingly, the overall efficiency of the converter significantly deteriorates. This paper proposes the hybrid PWM aiming to improve the efficiency of the SRC with a bridgeless boost rectifier in a wide input voltage regulation range. The converter swaps between the overlapping and the proposed short-pulse PWM schemes to drive the MOSFETs in the bridgeless boost rectifier. The transition between the two PWM schemes is defined according to the boundary condition that relies upon the operating point of the converter power and the input voltage. The proposed hybrid PWM scheme is analyzed and compared to the overlapping PWM at different levels of the input voltage and the load power. A 300 W prototype was studied in the laboratory to show the feasibility of the proposed hybrid PWM scheme with the closed-loop control system to switch between the two PWM schemes."

In this study, we describe a simple strategy that can use GEANT4 simulations to produce a hemispherical particle source. We initially generate random points on a spherical surface of practical radius by using a Gaussian distribution for the three components of the Cartesian coordinates, thereby obtaining a generating surface for the initial position of the particles to be tracked. Since we do not require the bottom half of the sphere, we take the absolute value of the vertical coordinate, resulting in a hemisphere. Next, we direct the generated particles into the target body by selectively favoring the momentum direction along the vector constructed between a random point on the hemispherical surface and the origin of the target, thereby minimizing particle loss through source biasing. We also discuss a second scheme where the coordinate transformation is performed between the spherical and Cartesian coordinates, and the above-source biasing procedure is applied to orient the generated muons towards the target. Finally, a recipe based on restrictive planes from our previous study is discussed. We implement our strategies by using G4ParticleGun in the GEANT4 code. While we apply these techniques to simulations for muon tomography via scattering, these source schemes can be applied to similar studies for atmospheric sciences, space engineering, and astrophysics where a 3D particle source is a necessity."

In soil and roots, the fungal richness and relative abundance of pathogens and saprotrophs were mainly affected by sampling time. While sampling time affected fungal composition in soil, root fungal communities were also significantly affected by cultivar.

An incremental test was used to determine ventilatory thresholds (VT1, VT2) and maximal oxygen uptake (VO2kg), followed by a sprint test to evaluate anaerobic performance. Cyclists' performance phenotype was determined as the ratio of power at VT2 to 5 s peak sprint power. Juniors exhibited sprinter-like traits, excelling in all functional tests except for lactate levels post-sprint. SmO2data showed no age-related or bilateral differences across participants. The combined mean response time (MRT) revealed stronger bilateral goodness of fit (R2= 0.64) than individual time delay (TD) and time constant (√è‚Äû). Higher VO2kgat VT2, peak power, and maximal uptake were linked to longer TD, while shorter TD correlated with higher lactate production and increased fatigue. Bilaterally averaged SmO2kinetics distinguished between sprint and endurance athletes, indicating the potential to reflect the alactic anaerobic system's capacity and depletion. Age did not affect desaturation rates, but younger cyclists showed greater response amplitude, attributed to a higher initial baseline rather than maximal desaturation at the end of the exercise."

The sector should be able to fully operate within an environmentally, socially, and financially acceptable structure. A holistic shipping pollution and emissions index, for example, must also include financial or economic quantification of the major environmental impacts. Thus, using empirical data collated from the industry, uncontrolled observations, and experts' interviews, we present the annual CO2emissions and the related emissions costs of a typical 7-day cruise that operates within the Baltic Sea region (BSR) as well as a waste management report from the port of Saint Petersburg. The result is a detailed energy demand and cost inventory assessment of cruise trips and their overall impact on the clean shipping campaign of the maritime industry.

It has been established that to ensure effective safety management of industrial enterprises, one of the critical areas is the technical diagnostics of power equipment during operation. An assessment of the actual technical condition of power equipment of VVER-1000 power units is proposed based on establishing the aging mechanisms and determining the relative evaluation coefficients for the characteristics of individual equipment elements. The results of the calculations allowed us to conclude that the obtained results correspond to the coefficients of relative assessment Ki of the technical characteristics of the power equipment that determine its degradation. Studies indicates that when assessing the state of power equipment, it is necessary to consider the presence and impact of the following operational factors that are not considered in the design calculations: loads, high levels of mechanical stress, fatigue damage, and metal defects, which primarily indicate the presence of degradation changes. To assess the technical condition of the equipment, considering the degree of mechanical wear, 17 technical characteristics were selected to determine the aging mechanisms by signs of degradation. A mathematical model of the dependence of the relative evaluation coefficient K on changes in the operating parameters is presented, and it is noted that the most significant influence on the value of the coefficient is the temperature of the coolant at the inlet (K= 0.56). The developed approach makes it possible to improve the safety management system of power facilities by introducing the proposed model to assess the technical conditions of power equipment by defining the parameters in the overall safety management system."

The study encompassed analyses of organic and mineral matter content, grain size, microbiology, and heavy metal concentrations, totalling 1649 measurements. Comparisons with previous data revealed stable organic matter concentrations in lake and marine sediments over the last decade. Microbiological contamination in curative mud samples was relatively low, indicating cleanliness. Petroleum product concentrations varied, with Haapsalu at 42√Ç¬†mg/kg, V‰rska at 118.6√Ç¬†mg/kg, and K‰ina below the limit of quantification. Phenol concentrations were generally below the limit of quantification, except for V‰rska. Pesticides were found in V‰rska samples, but in other sediments, levels were below the limit of quantification. Average heavy metal concentrations in curative mud decreased between 2013&2014 and 2022, remaining below the target value. The study's results are crucial for curative mud-related entrepreneurship in Estonia, facilitating compliance with the new regulatory standards.

Such measurements are called passive, since there is no need to move the transmitter after its position has been fixed.

However, a major challenge remains: delivering the CRISPR machinery to the nucleus of recipient cells in a nontoxic and efficient manner. In this article, we repurpose an RNA-delivering cell-penetrating peptide, PepFect14 (PF14), to deliver Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP). The RNP-CPP complex achieved high editing rates, e.g., up to 80% in HEK293T cells, while being active at low nanomolar ranges without any apparent signs of toxicity. The editing efficiency was similar to or better compared to the commercially available reagents RNAiMAX and CRISPRMax. The efficiency was thoroughly evaluated in reporter cells and wild-type cells by restriction enzyme digest and next-generation sequencing. Furthermore, the CPP-Cas9-RNP complexes were demonstrated to withstand storage at different conditions, including freeze-thaw cycles and freeze-drying, without a loss in editing efficiency. This CPP-based delivery strategy complements existing technologies and further opens up new opportunities for Cas9 RNP delivery, which can likely be extended to other gene editors in the future."

It has been estimated that approximately 8.9 GW of solar power plants, and 3.6 GW of wind power plants, will be decommissioned from 2044 to 2059, and that the cost of the raw materials recovered could reach EUR 421.4 million and EUR 124.6 million in 2021 prices, respectively, compared to the decommissioning costs of EUR 240.1 million and EUR 49.1 million, respectively. Decommissioning renewable power plants will require the creation of new jobs, including 11.6 thousand in the solar industry, and 2.8 thousand in the wind sector. It is essential to amend the legislation in Ukraine, particularly Directive 2012/19/EU, to introduce the principle of the extended producer responsibility to ensure the efficient recycling of renewable power plant end-of-life equipment in Ukraine in the future."

Medicines-related concerns were more common among Russians (p= 0.037), however, they sought less contact to consult a pharmacist than Estonians (p< 0.001). Furthermore, expectations about different medicines-related services in the future were higher among Estonians than among Russians (p< 0.001). Community pharmacists in Estonia should focus more on person-centered care to better meet the expectations and needs of different ethnic groups about medicines-related services. It is also important to reduce the language barrier and to increase the recognition of cultural traditions by health professionals."

However, for efficient planning to support an additional load, an accurate assessment of the electric vehicle load and power quality indices is required. Although several EV models to estimate the charging profile and additional electrical load are available, but they are not capable of providing a high-resolution evaluation of charging current, especially at a higher frequency. This paper presents a probabilistic approach capable of estimating the time-dependent charging and harmonic currents for the future EV load. The model is based on the detailed travel activities of the existing car owners reported in the travel survey. The probability distribution functions of departure time, distance, arrival time, and time span are calculated. The charging profiles are based on the measurements of several EVs."

In this study, xylose, the main component of hemicellulose, was used as the sole substrate forR. toruloides, and a detailed physiology characterisation combined with absolute proteomics and genome-scale metabolic models was carried out to understand the regulation of lipid and carotenoid production. To improve these productions, oxidative stress was induced by hydrogen peroxide and light irradiation and further enhanced by adaptive laboratory evolution. Based on the online measurements of growth and CO2excretion, three distinct growth phases were identified during batch cultivations. Majority of the intracellular flux estimations showed similar trends with the measured protein levels and demonstrated improved NADPH regeneration, phosphoketolase activity and reduced √é¬≤-oxidation, correlating with increasing lipid yields. Light irradiation resulted in 70% higher carotenoid and 40% higher lipid content compared to the optimal growth conditions. The presence of hydrogen peroxide did not affect the carotenoid production but culminated in the highest lipid content of 0.65 g/gDCW. The adapted strain showed improved fitness and 2.3-fold higher carotenoid content than the parental strain. This work presents a holistic view of xylose conversion into microbial oil and carotenoids byR. toruloides, in a process toward renewable and cost-effective production of these molecules."

However, uncertainty over local redox conditions and the degree of hydrographic restriction in the formation has led to contradictory interpretations regarding global oxygen (O2) fugacity.

In this study, we explore whether maintaining higher ESG ratings reduces the systemic risks of firms in a stock market context. For this purpose we analyse the systemic risk indicators of the constituent stocks of S&P Europe 350 for the period of January 2016&September 2020, which also partly covers the COVID-19 period. We apply a VAR-MGARCH model to extract the volatilities and correlations of the return shocks of these stocks. Then, we obtain the systemic risk indicators by applying a principle components approach to the estimated volatilities and correlations. Our focus is on the impact of ESG ratings on systemic risk indicators, while we consider network centralities, volatilities and financial performance ratios as control variables. We use fixed effects and OLS methods for our regressions. Our results indicate that (1) the volatility of a stock's returns and its centrality measures in the stock network are the main sources contributing to the systemic risk measure, (2) firms with higher ESG ratings face up to 7.3% less systemic risk contribution and exposure compared to firms with lower ESG ratings and (3) COVID-19 augmented the partial effects of volatility, centrality measures and some financial performance ratios. When considering only the COVID-19 period, we find that social and governance factors have statistically significant impacts on systemic risk."

To integrate battery energy storage systems (BESS) to an utility-scale 1500 V PV system, one of the key design considerations is the basic architecture selection between DC- and AC-coupling. Hence, it is necessary to assess the reliability of the power conversion units, which are not only the key system components, but also represent the most reliability-critical parts, in order to ensure an efficient and reliable 1500 V PV-battery system. Thus, this paper investigates the BESS solutions of DC- and AC-coupled configurations for 1500 V PV systems with a comparative reliability analysis. The reliability analysis is carried out through a case study on a 160 kW/1500 V PV-system integrated DC- or AC-coupled BESS for PV power smoothing and ramp-rate regulation. In the analysis, all of the DC-DC and DC-AC power interfacing converters are taken into consideration along with component-, converter-, and system-level reliability evaluation. The results reveal that the reliability of the 1500 V PV inverter can be enhanced with the DC-coupled BESS, while seen from the system-level reliability (i.e., a PV-battery system), both of the DC- and AC-coupled BESSs will affect the overall system reliability, especially for the DC-coupled case. The findings can be added into the design phase of 1500 V PV systems in a way to further lower the cost of energy."

Cellulose fatty acid esters are first synthesized from microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), then dissolved in pyridine solution, and after the solvent cast into thin films. The cellulose fatty acid ester acylation process is characterized by the FTIR method. Cellulose esters hydrophobicity is evaluated with contact angle measurements. The mechanical properties of the films are tested with the tensile test. For all the synthesized films, FTIR provides clear evidence of acylation by showing the presence of characteristic peaks. Films' mechanical properties are comparable to those of generally used plastics such as LDPE and HDPE. Furthermore, it appears that with an increase in the side-chain length, the water barrier properties showed improvement. These results show that they could potentially be suitable materials for films and packaging materials."

For this, we utilised fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) using data from 128 micro firms operating in different manufacturing industries in Estonia. Three paths were identified for explaining circular economy practices in internationally operating micro-firms and two paths for explaining it in micro-firms that do not operate internationally. Our results show that understanding the impact of the four before-mentioned aspects can be beneficial for engaging in circular economy efforts in both international and non-international micro-firms. The intricate five pathways (three for international and two for non-international) through which environmental awareness, stakeholder pressure, circular economy orientation, and internal barriers shape circular economy practices in micro-firms, challenging conventional understandings and offering nuanced insights for effective engagement in sustainable business practices. Based on the findings, theoretical and practical implications of this study and directions for future research are discussed."

The story selected for observation was written in 2001, focusing on events in Soviet Estonia (1940‚Äì1941, 1944‚Äì1991). At the time of telling this story, the Soviet era was publicly interpreted as a period of interruption of Estonian cultural and political continuity. Social scientists observed the Soviet period from the perspective of cultural trauma. In this way, the narrator presented complex past events in a framework that points to the restoration of historical justice. Although this story represents a positive attitude towards historical and cultural developments in Estonia, the analysis of this story indicates that traces of trauma can be found at the levels of the story that reflect the formation of the narrator‚Äôs identity."

The operationalisation of the model builds on an initial student-relevant, societal issue-related contextualisation involving STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) while focusing on developing science conceptual learning. The model extends to not only considering socio-scientific issues, but seeks to promote trans-contextualisation beyond the school setting, seeking to raise awareness of an active informed citizenry, related to environmental, economic and social sustainability. The components of active informed citizenry are described and a trans-contextual science teaching example based on the model is put forward in this article."

The earth suffers from extreme air pollution, climate changes, and extreme problems due to the enormous usage of underground carbon resources applications materialized in industrial, transport, and domestic sectors. The countries under Gulf Cooperation Council, i.e., Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, mainly explore those underground carbon resources for crude oil extraction and natural gas production. As a nonrenewable resource, these are bound to be exhausted in the near future. Hence, this review discusses the importance and feasibility of renewable sources in the Gulf region to persuade the scientific community to launch and explore renewable sources to obtain the maximum benefit in electric power generation. In most parts of the Gulf region, solar and wind energy sources are abundantly available. However, attempts to harness those resources are very limited. Furthermore, in this review report, innovative areas of advanced research (such as bioenergy, biomass) were proposed for the Gulf region to extract those resources at a higher magnitude to generate surplus power generation. Overall, this report clearly depicts the current scenario, current power demand, currently installed capacities, and the future strategies of power production from renewable power sources (viz., solar, wind, tidal, biomass, and bioenergy) in each and every part of the Gulf region."

Since these come with their own dangers, viz. attachment and not putting wealth to good use, wealth may be nice but not more. That someone is better than someone else because of birth and inheritance rather than action is, however, established as completely non-Buddhist, again and again, even by the Buddha himself."

Traditional diagnostics often suffer from data inaccuracies and limitations in analytical techniques. The focus is on enhancing the dynamic model accuracy for remote induction motor control in both closed- and open-loop speed control systems, which is essential for real-time process monitoring. The proposed solution includes real-time measurements of input and output physical quantities to mitigate inaccuracies in traditional diagnostic methods. The manuscript discusses theoretical aspects of nonlinear torque formation in induction drives and introduces a dynamic model employing vector control and speed control schemes alongside standard frequency control methods. These approaches optimize frequency converter settings to enhance system performance under varying nonlinear conditions. Additionally, the manuscript explores methods to analyze dynamic, systematic errors arising from frequency converter inertial properties, thereby improving electromechanical equipment condition diagnostics. By addressing these challenges, the manuscript significantly advances the field, offering a promising future with enhanced dynamic model accuracy, real-time monitoring techniques, and advanced control methods to optimize system reliability and performance."
2024,Wolfgang Wagner,"Natural origins of social essentialism: Ethnic groups, identities, and cultural transmission",,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1354067X241236722,,,"This paper argues that the term ‚Äòsocial essence‚Äô is overused in psychological research and includes instances that are not covered by the basic definition of an essentialist cognition with living beings. Imagining an essence of living beings is conceptualized as a meta- cognition that wraps up an exemplars‚Äô characteristics as a marker and assigns it a kind or species. This paper develops a framework of how social essentialism can be con- ceptualised to originate in natural contexts. Ethnic groups maintain a group identity that is defined by a set of diacritical markers and secured by a rule of endogamy, which functionally replicates the procreative pattern in animal species. This ‚Äòfunctional ho- mological‚Äô relationship construes a group identity in the image of animal kinds. Thus construed, an ethnic identity appears as a natural given that safeguards the group‚Äôs cohesion and stability across generations. Hence, group-related essentialism primarily serves identity formation and provides a cognitive mechanism to distinguish the ingroup from outgroups. The intuition of an essentialised identity is perpetuated across gener- ations by bio-social processes of enculturation. Such processes can explain an historically stable group essentialism, as well as group-biased judgements in former and contem- porary societies without the need for innate sources of psychological essentialism."

This study was conducted for solar and wind power plants with different installed capacities. The Levelized Cost of Electricity and the payback period for such power plants were calculated considering the ongoing feed-in tariffs and discount rates determined by various equity and debt capital ratios. The results showed that the state support provides attractive payback periods for solar and wind power plants with an installed capacity of √¢‚Ä∞¬•30 kW. In comparison, 5 kW solar power plants and wind power plants with a capacity of up to 10 kW are not paid off during the power plants' lifecycle. It confirmed that the ongoing energy policy in Ukraine's residential sector is still designed to obtain profits by the owners of generating facilities by selling the excess electricity. In the meantime, its main goal: providing households energy independence: has been levelled. To resolve the issues caused by such a state support model, a methodical approach to improve the feed-in tariff calculation is proposed. In addition, recommendations for reconsidering other policy measures to ensure effective renewable energy development in the residential sector have been made."

Owing to the rectifier mode changes, the converter duty cycle can be restricted to a range with a favorable efficiency. It is shown that the performance of such converters depends on the front-end inverter type. The study considers current- and impedance-source front-end topologies, as they are the most relevant in high step-up applications. It is explained why the full- and half-bridge implementations provide essentially different performances. Unlike the half-bridge, the full-bridge implementation shows step changes in efficiency during the rectifier mode changes, which could compromise the long-term reliability of the converter. The theoretical predictions are corroborated by experimental examples to compare performance with different boost front-end inverters."

The collection includes novel contributions from well-studied countries like France or the United Kingdom, cases from Scandinavia and Mediterranean countries, as well as articles from post-socialist cities where the majority of LHEs are situated, and as such presents the diversity of experiences that has emerged in housing estates across Europe in the last two decades. Since the global turn towards neoliberal governance regimes at the end of the 20th century the commodification of housing, accompanied by the financialization of real estate, has not left any housing markets or market segments untouched. All articles focus on the interconnections between problems found in the development of housing estates and the processes of privatization and marketization.

We find that productivity gains resulting from export entry are significantly larger for specific types of exports, such as exports of knowledge-intensive services, intermediate goods and re-exports. These exports correspond to activities that generate high value added within GVCs. Our findings indicate that the intensity of interactions with global buyers alongside exporters' room for technology catch-up define the extent of learning by exporting in GVCs."

Secondly, the case of Estonia demonstrates a scenario much anticipated across Europe, where anti-immigrant parties get in charge of immigration policy. Since April 2019, the anti-immigrant Conservative People's Party of Estonia (EKRE) has been a junior partner in a conservative governing coalition. While EKRE had not been able to achieve substantial change in immigration policy in their first year in government, the COVID-19 pandemic was an opportunity to set the agenda for more restrictive labor migration policy."

This is achieved through systems that make their models of student learning and instruction transparent to teachers. We use bibliometric network analysis and topic modelling to explore the synergies between the related research groups and the main research topics considered in the 42 reviewed papers. Network analysis depicts an early stage community, made up of several research groups, mainly from the fields of learning analytics and intelligent tutoring systems, which have had little explicit and implicit collaboration but do share a common core literature. Th resulting topics from the topic modelling can be grouped into the ones related to teacher practices, such as awareness and reflection, learning orchestration, or assessment frameworks, and the ones related to the technology used to open up the models to teachers, such as dashboards or adaptive learning architectures. Moreover, results show that research in MbLA has taken an individualistic approach to student learning and instruction, neglecting social aspects and elements of collaborative learning. To advance research in MbLA, future research should focus on hybrid teacher&AI approaches that foster the partnership between teachers and technology to support the learning process, involve teachers in the development cycle from an early stage, and follow an interdisciplinary approach."

Concerning the high speed, the proposed architecture employs a two-stage pipelining and a Karatsuba finite field multiplier. The use of pipelining shortens the critical path which ultimately improves the clock frequency. Similarly, the employment of a Karatsuba multiplier decreases the required number of clock cycles. Moreover, an efficient rescheduling of point addition and doubling operations avoids data hazards that appear due to pipelining. Regarding the low area, the proposed architecture computes finite field squaring and inversion operations using the hardware resources of the Karatsuba multiplier. Furthermore, two dedicated controllers are used for efficient control functionalities. The implementation results after place-and-route are provided on Virtex-7, Spartan-7, Artix-7 and Kintex-7 FPGA (field-programmable gate arrays) devices. The utilized FPGA slices are 5102 (on Virtex-7), 5634 (on Spartan-7), 5957 (on Artix-7) and 6102 (on Kintex-7).

For performance comparison, a figure-of-merit in terms ofthroughputareais utilized which shows that the proposed architecture is 963.3 and 2.76 times faster as compared to the related architectures. In terms of latency, the proposed architecture is 302.7 and 132.88 times faster when compared to the most relevant state-of-the-art approaches.

The stability of hybrid AC/DC microgrids heavily relies on the AC mains frequency and the DC-link voltage, and deviations in these factors can lead to undesirable outcomes such as load curtailments and power system congestions and blackouts. This paper introduces a unique approach that leverages bidirectional virtual inertia support to enhance the stability and reliability of hybrid AC/DC microgrids under weak grid conditions. The proposed strategy employs virtual inertia as a buffer to mitigate rapid changes in DC-link voltage and AC frequency, thereby enhancing system stability margins. This strategy significantly contributes to a more stable and reliable grid operation by reducing voltage and frequency fluctuations. A standard hybrid AC/DC microgrid configuration is used to implement the bidirectional virtual inertia support, where a bidirectional interlinking converter control is adjusted to deliver inertia support to both the AC and DC subgrids. This converter utilizes the DC grid voltage and AC grid frequency as inputs, effectively managing active power balance and implementing auxiliary functions. Extensive simulations are conducted under weak grid conditions and standalone mode to validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. The simulation results demonstrate a remarkable improvement in frequency nadir, rate-of-change-of-frequency (RoCoF), and DC bus voltage deviation in the hybrid AC/DC microgrids. The bidirectional virtual inertia support substantially reduces voltage and frequency fluctuations, enhancing the microgrid stability and resilience. There is an improvement of over 45% and 25% in the frequency deviation and voltage deviation, respectively, achieved through implementing the proposed control strategy."

These inverters have been proposed for the uninterruptible power supplies, high and low-voltage/power photovoltaic systems, low-power fuel cell, different low- and high-voltage battery and/or electric vehicle chargers, audio amplifiers. The fully controlled switches on both terminals of these converters typically can provide the bidirectional power transfer capability, which is also addressed for most of the topologies, but requires some modification in their modulation strategy. Average efficiency of today's isolated matrix inverters is comparable with the two-stage power converters; however, they can provide higher reliability and lower cost."

Three different endometrium receptivity stages, namely pre-receptive, post-receptive, and receptive, were compared. An ensemble-based AI model was proposed for histology image segmentation, which is based on individual UNet++, UNet, and ResNet34-UNet segmentation models. The performance of the ensemble-based technique was assessed using the Dice score and intersection over unit (IoU) values. In comparison to alternative segmentation architectures that were applied singly, the current ensemble-based method obtained higher Dice score (0.95) and IoU (0.90) values. The statistical comparison highlighted a noticeable difference in the number of nuclei and the size of the stroma tissue. The proposed technique demonstrated the positive potential for practical implementation for automatic endometrial tissue analysis."

Correspondence Analysis (CA) and Hierarchical Cluster Analysis show that participants in both age groups share three clusters of words associated with √¢‚Ç¨≈ìhappiness√¢‚Ç¨¬ù:Tangible happiness,Affective happinessandSerene happiness. We noted more differences in the associations with √¢‚Ç¨≈ìunhappiness,√¢‚Ç¨¬ù for which the two groups share only two clusters:LossandEveryday problems.A distinct third cluster,Affective unhappiness, emerged for the younger women, whereas older women's associations are further differentiated into a more complex structure, including two more clusters:DejectionandApprehension. Additionally, CA shows that in both age groups, self-reported happiness levels do not discriminate which words are associated with happiness and unhappiness. Finally, qualitative content analysis of a questionnaire item investigating how to reach complete happiness suggested that there are three recurring answer types: happiness can be improved through external changes, internal changes, or not at all because complete/permanent happiness does not exist. The study provides a methodological design which, unlike most happiness studies, allows participants the freedom to bring up the meaning of happiness and unhappiness. Thus, the study constitutes a contribution to a more nuanced understanding√Ç¬†of happiness."

The study collected the views of active teachers who have applied for the PS and those of the assessors to understand the shortcomings in the application and the expectations for the application process. The main challenges identified are that teachers lack respective skills to adequately comprehend qualification requirements (unambiguous interpretation of PS) and the lack of evidence-based performance indicators (difficult to prove) and weak self-analysis skills; hence, the teacher needs assistance. The research found that teachers need collaborative support, motivation and constructive feedback on their professional development (PD), both from colleagues and at school and national levels. Based on this research, it can be said that teachers who have gone through the application process have gained greater self-confidence, value themselves as teachers and continue their in-service training."

The modelling equations of the HEV include vehicle acceleration and jerk, so that simulations can investigate the vehicle drivability and comfortability with different control parameters. A model predictive control (MPC) scheme with softened constraints for this HEV is developed. The new MPC with softened constraints shows its superiority over the MPC with hard constraints as it provides a faster setpoint tracking and smoother clutch engagement. The conversion of some hard constraints into softened constraints can improve the MPC stability and robustness. The MPC with softened constraints can maintain the system stability, while the MPC with hard constraints becomes unstable if some input constraints lead to the violation of output constraints."

It is based on the series resonance dc-dc converter (SRC) topology and a novel boost rectifier. The proposed topology has a smaller number of semiconductors than its SRC-based existing topologies employing an ac-switch in the boost rectifier. The proposed dc-dc converter comprises only two diodes and one switch at the output side, while the existing solutions use two switches and two diodes to step up the voltage. The proposed converter boosts the input voltage within a single boosting interval in the positive half-cycle of the switching period. In addition, the resonant current in the negative half-cycle is sinusoidal, which could enhance the converter efficiency. The resonant capacitor voltage is clamped at the level of the output voltage. Therefore, the voltage stress of the capacitor could significantly reduce at various input voltage and power levels. This makes it perfect for distributed generation applications such as photovoltaics with wide variations of input voltage and power. The converter operates at the fixed switching frequency close to the resonance frequency to obtain the maximum efficiency at the nominal input voltage. The zero-voltage switching (ZVS) feature is achieved in the primary semiconductors, while the diodes in the output-side rectifier turn off at nearly zero current switching. The mathematical model and design guidelines of the proposed converter are discussed in the paper. The experimental results confirmed the theoretical analysis based on a 300 W prototype. The maximum efficiency of the converter was 96.8% at the nominal input voltage, and the converter has achieved a wider input voltage regulation range than that with the boosting cell comprising an ac-switch."

As expected, the main challenge in providing 5G connectivity on the sea is to provide coverage over large areas of open water. Thus, as a starting point, this paper presents a measurement campaign that was conducted to assess the current coverage in the Baltic Sea, which concluded that the current terrestrial networks cannot guarantee sufficient coverage. Next, the solution architecture and trials proposed by 5G-ROUTES are described, which are based on the integration of satellite and leading-edge multi-hop connectivity in 5G networks. Utilizing satellite backhaul can potentially overcome the connectivity challenge from the terrestrial domain to the maritime domain, while multi-hop connectivity ensures that coverage is extended among the different ships that are navigating the sea. Furthermore, this paper describes how the project will evaluate, in field trials tailored to this maritime environment, common connectivity key performance indicators (KPIs) such as latency, throughput, availability and reliability. This paper concludes by providing a vision for applying the obtained results and insights to maritime transportation and other remote areas where the deployment of a suitable 5G infrastructure may be challenging or costly. The findings will be used to guide the design of future 5G networks for marine applications and to identify the most effective methods for providing secure and dependable communication in a maritime setting."

A well-calibrated classifier correctly quantifies the level of uncertainty or confidence associated with its instance-wise predictions. This is essential for critical applications, optimal decision making, cost-sensitive classification, and for some types of context change. Calibration research has a rich history which predates the birth of machine learning as an academic field by decades. However, a recent increase in the interest on calibration has led to new methods and the extension from binary to the multiclass setting. The space of options and issues to consider is large, and navigating it requires the right set of concepts and tools. We provide both introductory material and up-to-date technical details of the main concepts and methods, including proper scoring rules and other evaluation metrics, visualisation approaches, a comprehensive account of post-hoc calibration methods for binary and multiclass classification, and several advanced topics."
2024,Wolfgang Wagner,Can essences mix? An essentialist theory of genetic hybrids in the human and animal domain,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.newideapsych.2023.101061,,,"This paper reviews research on biological essentialist beliefs and what these entail for perceiving genetic hybrids. It is suggested that hybrid perception results from the characteristics of essentialist reasoning, according to which living beings are endowed with a specific identity as a member of a natural kind. The most important elements of attributing an essence onto an individual are its perceived causal power to determine group membership, being immutable, discrete with regard to an individual's membership in exactly one category, making members of a category appear homogeneous, and ensuring intergenerational stability. Mixing two essences as in genetic engineering strips the hybrid of an unambiguous identity in perception, and results in its devaluation. Such devaluation seems to occur on a non-conscious level and across cultures. The basic claims not only hold for animal beings but also apply to the human domain and to inter-ethnic procreation, primarily for respondents with conservative worldviews."

A comprehensive HEV model is built that is simulated on different driving cycles of Federal Test Procedure 75 (FTP75), New York City Cycle (NYCC), Highway Fuel Economy Test (HWFET), and Extra Urban Driving Cycle (EUDC). Data achieved from these simulations were analysed and tested with several fuel regression models to determine the best fuel regression estimation for HEV fuel consumption on the basis of their weights and tire radiuses. The best fuel regression equation is obtained with a determination coefficient R-squared greater than 99%. Lastly, the optimal model and other HEVs models are simulated on different driving cycles to prove that the fuel consumption of our best-fit regression model is the best."

The method should allow security experts to think about the future by considering √¢‚Ç¨≈ìwhat if√¢‚Ç¨¬ù situations, and creatively assess the probability of different threats, even those that appear as improbable to others. The components of the method include strategic fit (the actor's competence between its abilities and the needs of market), structure (the degree of concentration and maturity), competitive advantages (the extent to which the resources denied to the competition can be gathered, for example, access to novel technology), and strategic focus (i.e., on cost advantages, a differentiated product or exploitation of a market niche), in which a strategic advantage can be obtained by changing rules or deliberately creating turbulence. Strategic imagination can promote an academic discussion on changing nature of global processes like the emergence of global security market and provide nonorthodox methods for advancing a qualitative security analysis. Educated forecasting by connecting today's developments with strategic imagination offers an important component in building successful security strategies and supportive public policies, especially in what concerns psychological warfare. For example, in the current COVID-19 crisis, main efforts have been made to defend against its national consequences (e.g., various restrictions introduced by individual countries), and less attention has been paid to cooperative strategies that can significantly reduce the global spread of the virus."

The semi-structured interviews were conducted with parents. The theoretical aspect features family language policies and strategies, identity and its types, globalisation forces, bilingualism, and multiculturalism. The research aimed at highlighting the reasons behind parents' ideological decision, more specifically, on how these bilingual families manage and adapt their language policies. The study shows how families control their chosen strategies. Research revealed in which languages children prefer to speak if they have been raised in multilingual environment. The results demonstrated that parents prefer to use a one parent&one language approach and they are led by their intuition and desire to speak in their own mother tongue with their children. It was found that bilingual reading to children during their first years contributes to their ability to speak in both parents' mother tongues. Data showed that bilingual children living in Tallinn prefer to speak Estonian while having competency in both languages. This study revealed that parents were content about their children being bilingual."

Four different edible coatings were applied, namely, T1 (1% TM + 0.75% glycerol + 0.5% BSO), T2 (5% TM + 0.75% glycerol + 0.5% BSO), T3 (0.75% glycerol + 0.5% BSO), and T4 (1% chitosan + 0.75% glycerol + 0.5% BSO). Different quality parameters, including weight loss, surface color, firmness, chlorophyll, vitamin C, phenolic content, antioxidant, malondialdehyde, and microbial load, were measured at a regular interval. Significant differences were observed between the coated and uncoated (control) fruits. Compared to the control fruit, weight loss was decreased in all the treated fruits, and T2 treatment retained the highest weight compared to other treatments. Fruits treated with T2 and T4 treatments retained high levels of vitamin C throughout the storage period. After 9 days, T4 treatment showed the lowest increase of microbial growth compared to other treatments. At the end of the storage period, results showed that the sample treated with 5% mucilage retained a higher level of polyphenol, antioxidant, and vitamin C content. Furthermore, the addition of BSO improved the antibacterial and antioxidant properties of coated guava. The results of this study indicate that a polysaccharide-based edible coating mixed with BSO improved the quality parameters and extended the shelf-life."

The methods used in this study, including factor and cluster analysis, taxonomy, and dendrograms, enabled the development of development programs for two clusters of hotels: those located in areas with increased military risk and those in relatively safe territories. The taxonomic analysis revealed significant differences in managerial practices and operational efficiency, largely determined by the geographic location of the hotels. Hotels in active combat zones experienced a 40% reduction in tourist flow and financial instability, while hotels in safe areas demonstrated a 30% higher level of customer satisfaction. The application of advanced security systems and modern marketing techniques led to a 40% reduction in incidents."

Participants included 719 mother&child dyads. Children's perceptions of parental help and math skills were assessed in both grades; children's math-related self-concept, interest, and mother-rated task persistence were assessed only in Grade 6. Three similar profiles of parental help appeared in both grades. Most mothers and children belonged to theAverage support and controlprofile (around 60% in both grades); 29&33% belonged to theAverage support, high controlprofile; and 8&11% belonged to theLow support, below average controlprofile. Profiles differed based on children's self-concept, task persistence, and math skills in Grade 6. Transitions of parental homework help predicted children's math skills in Grade 9. These findings help to conceptualize parental homework help as a multidimensional construct that may manifest in three different profiles which differentially relate to the child's skills and motivation."

The economic assessment of WHRS installations in the shipping sector is not widely covered in the literature. A reason for this might be that the conventional financial evaluation of sensitive choices is commonly done through capital budgeting methods, which are not flexible enough to integrate future changes in fuel prices and long-term aspects of other costs. Thus, this work evaluates the WHRS investment using the classical budgeting instruments as well as the real-options approach (a more sophisticated approach) to accommodate the presumed expected future changes in the volatile maritime markets. Following the methodology of triangulation, three case studies of ships with varying operational conditions empirically validate the result to depict the practical use of the real-options evaluation method in investment assessment. The capital budgeting analysis reveals that the investment in maritime WHRS technology is only economically favorable under certain frame conditions projected in the work that shows a more realistic assessment of the project."

This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of how Estonian students use Spanish articles. 345 written texts from a learner corpus have been analysed. Results show that the most common error among learners is omission of the article, in line with previous research, but also an unexpectedly high incidence of morphological and syntactic errors. Moreover, it has been detected that there is not a significant improvement in article acquisition between levels A1 and B1. By addressing these objectives, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of the specific difficulties faced by Estonian learners and the broader landscape of article acquisition in a third language context."

We bring in insights from prior literature and use an illustrative case study of an Italian SME to demonstrate the interplay of entrepreneurial and non-entrepreneurial behaviour during the internationalization process. Our study shows that the combination of entrepreneurial and non-entrepreneurial internationalization cannot be fully explained with existing International Entrepreneurship literature or other internationalization theories, as they do not take into account the nonlinear nature of internationalization or explain why the process seems to reach a √¢‚Ç¨Àúglass ceiling' beyond which it does not progress. The study concludes with a conceptual framework providing an alternative explanation. Based on our conceptual reasoning we propose that predominantly non-entrepreneurial internationalization can occur without developing a clearly defined internationalization strategy. Additionally, we argue that low commitment to internationalization prevents capability development and may lead to nonlinear internationalization. Furthermore, we suggest that family involvement may moderate a firm's international entrepreneurial orientation, consequently leading to more non-entrepreneurial internationalization."

We aimed to answer two key research questions: RQ1, whether and how the pandemic conditions affected the heritage language, societal language acquisition, and heritage language literacy learning environments in the five countries examined (Cyprus, Estonia, Germany, Israel, and Sweden); and RQ2, what is the nature of child and parental agency in facilitation of the possible changes in the corresponding five countries? Fifty semi-structured interviews (ten in each country) were conducted. The data highlighted the factors that triggered changes in family language policy during the pandemic and the role of the child's agency, parents, extended family, and social network during this period. Based on our findings, we argue that the pandemic conditions gave the children new opportunities for agency when it comes to language and literacy choice and communication with extended family members. This even facilitated new sources of input and suggested the active role of a child as an agent in shaping family language policy in the family."

We evaluated three different trapezoid models that are proposed in the literature for soil moisture monitoring in regions with mineral soils. Due to the tight capillary connection between water table and surface soil moisture, we hypothesized that the soil moisture indices retrieved from these models would be correlated with WTD measured in situ. Two trapezoid models were based on optical and thermal imagery, also known as Thermal-Optical TRApezoid Models (TOTRAM), and one was based on optical imagery alone, also known as the OPtical TRApezoid Model (OPTRAM). The models were applied to Landsat imagery from 2008 to 2019 and the derived soil moisture indices were compared with in-situ WTD from eight locations in two Estonian bogs. Our results show that only the OPTRAM index was significantly (p-value < 0.05) correlated in time with WTD (average Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.41 and 0.37, for original and anomaly time series, respectively), while the two tested TOTRAM indices were not. The highest temporal correlation coefficients (up to 0.8) were observed for OPTRAM over treeless parts of the bogs. An assessment of the spatial correlation between soil moisture indices and WTD indicated that all three models did not capture the spatial variation in water table depth. Instead, the spatial patterns of the indices were primarily attributable to vegetation patterns."

Spectral measurements were performed to determine the gas temperature and reactive species that could be important in the ALD process. The density of metastable argon atoms was estimated using tunable laser absorption spectroscopy. It was concluded that plasma heating of substrates did not affect film growth. The crystallization-enhancing effect of plasma observed in these experiments was due to the action of OH radicals produced in the plasma."

At the microscale, Fourier transform infrared, thermogravimetric analysis, and scanning electron microscopy investigations highlighted structural alterations in the fibers, with the removal of targeted components and rearrangement in the cell wall. These structural changes influenced unitary fiber properties. At the macroscale, both pretreatments increased the composites' tensile properties, despite their negative impact on fiber performance. Additionally, silane treatment improved composite performance thanks to higher performance of the fibers themselves and improved fiber compatibility with the PLA matrix brought on by the silane couplings. PLA composites reinforced by 30 wt.% alkali and silane treated hemp fibers exhibited the highest tensile strength (62 MPa), flexural strength (113 MPa), and Young's modulus (7.6 GPa). Overall, the paper demonstrates the applicability of locally grown, frost-retted hemp fibers for the development of bio-based composites with low density (1.13 to 1.23 g cm√¢ÀÜ‚Äô3)."
2023,Indrek Melts,"Interactions between farmers' adaptation strategies to climate change and Sustainable Development Goals in Tanzania, East Africa",https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/15/6/4911,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su15064911,,,"This study investigated the potential adaptation measures for farmers in the Mwanga and Same Districts of Tanzania and then assessed their positive and negative interactions towards potential contributions to the selected sustainable development goal (SDG) indicators of no poverty and zero hunger. A total of 200 household surveys were conducted, and 36 participants were interviewed as key informants. Moreover, four focus group discussions were conducted to identify potential adaptation strategies in the studied areas. The literature and expert judgement approaches were used to understand and assess the positive and negative interactions between adaptation strategies and the selected indicators of SDGs. A seven-point scale of SDG interactions was used to determine the interactions between identified adaptation strategies and selected SDG indicators. Qualitative data were subjected to content analysis, whereas quantitative data were analyzed through descriptive statistics. The finding revealed that some of the adaptation strategies (i.e., stream bank crop cultivation, valley bottom crop cultivation, and cultivating crops near water sources) considered potential at the household levels and had strong negative interactions on achieving SDG 2.4.1. Further, most farmers hardly employed strategies (i.e., use of extension officers, concrete irrigation channels, crop insurance schemes, and credit schemes) that had strong positive interactions on the selected SDG indicators. Moreover, most of the identified strategies (i.e., early maturity crops, planting drought-resistant crops, use of improved varieties, mixing improved and local varieties, mixing short and long duration varieties, and crop diversification) are enabling strategies (+1), which, despite their importance, may constrain (√¢ÀÜ‚Äô1) the income of small-scale farmers, food security, and poverty reduction. The importance of other strategies (i.e., irrigation infrastructures) must be addressed for better yields and positive impacts. Hence, achieving SDGs 1 and 2 in the studied areas will require the integration of different adaptation strategies that complement each other, and not by promoting only some strategies as used or suggested before. For example, the emphasis on using improved varieties and crop diversification should be complemented by access to credit schemes, irrigation infrastructures, crop insurance, and extension services at the village level."

In this prospective cohort study, the metabolome from in vitro-produced day 7 blastocysts with successful implantation (n= 11), blastocysts with failed implantation (n= 10), and plain culture media without embryos (n= 5) were included. Samples were analyzed using an AbsoluteIDQ√Ç¬Æp180 Targeted Metabolomics Kit with LC-MS/MS, and a total of 189 metabolites were analyzed from each sample. Blastocysts that resulted in successful embryo implantation had significantly higher levels of methionine sulfoxide (p< 0.001), DOPA (p< 0.05), spermidine (p< 0.001), acetylcarnitine-to-free-carnitine ratio (p< 0.05), C2 + C3-to-free-carnitine ratio (p< 0.05), and lower levels of threonine (nep < 0.001) and phosphatidylcholine PC ae C30:0 (p< 0.001) compared to control media. However, when compared to embryos that failed to implant, only DOPA, spermidine, C2/C0, (C2 + C3)/C0, and PC ae C30:0 levels differentiated significantly. In summary, our study identifies a panel of differential metabolites in the culture media of bovine blastocysts that could act as potential biomarkers for the selection of viable blastocysts before embryo transfer."

Hydrogen desorption was evaluated using thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS), and microstructural changes after the TDS test were examined. Results reveal that the amount of hydrogen absorbed by LPBF CrFeNiMn alloy was significantly higher than that in pulsed electric current sintered (PECS) CrFeNiMn alloy or in conventional 316L austenitic stainless steel. The observations are ascribed to the differences in the amount of hydrogen absorbed by the multicomponent lattice, dislocation densities, width of segregation range at cell walls created by the rapid cooling in LBPF, and vacancies remaining after cooling to room temperature. A hydrogen-charged LBPF transmission electron microscope (TEM) specimen was also characterized. Stacking faults and cracks along the (111)-planes of austenite were observed. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of the surface of the TDS-tested samples also indicated hydrogen-induced cracks and hydrogen-induced submicron pits at the grain boundary inclusions."

Utilizing 1:10 scale mini-cars with limited computational resources, we demonstrate that different driving speeds significantly alter the task of the driving model, challenging the generalization capabilities of systems trained at a singular speed profile. Our findings reveal that models trained to drive at high speeds struggle with slower speeds and vice versa. Consequently, testing an ADS at an inappropriate speed can lead to misjudgments about its competence. Additionally, we explore the impact of computational delays, common in real-world deployments, on driving performance. We present a novel approach to counteract the effects of delays by adjusting the target labels in the training data, demonstrating improved resilience in models to handle computational delays effectively. This method, crucially, addresses the effects of delays rather than their causes and complements traditional delay minimization strategies. These insights are valuable for developing robust autonomous driving systems capable of adapting to varying speeds and delays in real-world scenarios."

Three different methods of the position quintic polynomial, speed quartic polynomial, and symmetric polynomial function for generating the vehicle trajectories are presented and illustrated with simulations. The optimal trajectory is selected according to three criteria: Smoother curve, smaller tracking error, and shorter distance. The outcomes of this paper can be used for generating online trajectories for autonomous driving vehicles and auto-parking systems."

It aims not only to compensate for some pertinent aspects of the current 3D site modeling, such as vegetation and surrounding buildings, but also to investigate surface characteristics of existing contexts, such as visible sun vectors and material properties. These aspects are relevant for conducting a comprehensively environmental simulation, while averting negative microclimatic impacts when locating the new building into the existing context. Ultimately, this study may support architects for taking decision-making in conceptual design stage based on the real contextual conditions."

Participants (n=√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞201) were asked to review four different Brexit-related Facebook posts that linked to news articles from UK tabloids that were published between 2016 and 2019. Two of the posts were debunked as fake news, while the other two were verified as real news. The authors of each Facebook post were different: two from UK tabloids and two from unknown individuals. Respondents were asked to identify the credibility of the news posts in Facebook's news feed. The results indicate that the author of the post significantly influences users' perceived credibility. For instance, a fake news post from an individual is perceived as the least trustworthy, while a real news post from an individual and a fake news post from a tabloid are somewhat similarly perceived. The content of a post is seen as most trustworthy when it is a real news post from a tabloid and as least credible when it is a fake news post from an individual. Finally, in two cases, credibility can predict willingness to interact with a post. The research concludes with a set of recommendations for future research."

Gender breakdowns are offered. Survey data were collected from undergraduates in a total of 47 universities, using large sample sizes, similar measures and assessment methods in four countries: Argentina (N=√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞969), Estonia (N=√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞1053), Finland (N=√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞4403), and the United States (N=√¢‚Ç¨‚Ä∞2072). The results confirmed previous findings which suggest that a notable number of students experience bullying during university studies by fellow students and/or staff members, and a smaller number of students admit to bully their fellow students. The results add to previous knowledge by demonstrating remarkable cultural differences in the prevalence and forms of bullying and suggesting that bullying at the university level starts to transform similar to bullying in the workplace. The overall rates of bullying victimization and perpetration between students were the highest in Argentina, followed by the USA, Finland, and finally Estonia. However, victimization by university personnel was reported the most in Estonia, followed by Argentina, the USA, and Finland. Gender breakdowns in bullying experiences varied between countries. Verbal forms of bullying were common experiences. The most often reported form in all countries was unjustified criticism, belittling or humiliation related to academic performance. Students in the USA reported the highest frequencies in most forms of victimization. The results are discussed by reflecting on higher education features and comparing cultural characteristics of the countries. Practical implications are provided."

This AZO sensor utilizes a thin-film metal electrode (TFME) combined with an AZO-selective molecularly imprinted polymer (AZO&MIP). The AZO&MIP was directly generated on TFME through electrochemical polymerization from the solution containing two functional monomers: aniline (Ani) and m-phenylenediamine (mPD), and the template: AZO, which was afterwards removed to form AZO-selective cavities in the polymer matrix. The AZO&MIP preparation was characterized by electrochemical and ellipsometry measurements. Optimization of the synthesis parameters, including the charge density applied during electrodeposition, the monomer-to-template ratio, was performed to enhance the sensor's performance. The results demonstrated that the AZO sensor achieved a low limit of detection (LOD) of 3.6 nM and a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 11.8 nM in tap water, indicating its sensitivity in a complex aqueous environment. The sensor also exhibited satisfactory selectivity for AZO in both ultrapure and tap-water samples and achieved a good recovery (94&119%) for the target analyte. This study highlights the potential of MIP-based electrochemical sensors for the rapid and accurate detection of fungicide contaminants in water, contributing to the advancement of analytical tools for water-quality monitoring and risk assessment."

To achieve low latency, we have reduced the clock cycles by using: (i) three-shift buffers in the datapath to load Elliptic-curve parameters as well as an initial point, (ii) the identical size of input/output interfaces in all building blocks of the architecture. The low area is preserved by using the same hardware resources of squaring and multiplication for inversion computation. Finally, an efficient controller is used to control the inferred logic. The proposed ECP architecture is modeled in Verilog and the synthesis results are given on three different 7-series FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) devices, i.e., Kintex-7, Artix-7, and Virtex-7. The performance of the architecture is provided with the integration of a schoolbook multiplier (implemented with two different logic styles, i.e., combinational and sequential). On Kintex-7, the combinational implementation style of a schoolbook multiplier results in power-optimized, i.e., 161√é¬ºW, values with an expense of (i) hardware resources, i.e., 3561 look-up-tables and 1527 flip-flops, (ii) clock frequency, i.e., 227 MHz, and (iii) latency, i.e., 11.57√é¬ºs. On the same Kintex-7 device, the sequential implementation style of a schoolbook multiplier provides, (i) 2.88√é¬ºs latency, (ii) 1786 look-up-tables and 1855 flip-flops, (iii) 647√é¬ºW power, and (iv) 909 MHz clock frequency.

The targeted saponins were identified and quantified using a hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography with mass spectrometric detection (HILIC-MS) method. The simple and high-throughput extraction procedure was developed for solid oat- and pea-based food samples. In addition, a very simple extraction procedure for liquid samples, without the need to use lyophilisation, was also implemented. Oat seed flour (U-13C-labelled) and soyasaponin Ba were used as internal standards for avenacoside A and saponin B, respectively. Other saponins were relatively quantified based on avenacoside A and saponin B standard responses. The developed method was tested and successfully validated using oat and pea flours, protein concentrates and isolates, as well as their mixtures, and plant-based drinks. With this method, the saponins from oat- and pea-based products were separated and quantified simultaneously within 6 min. The use of respective internal standards derived from U-13C-labelled oat and soyasaponin Ba ensured high accuracy and precision of the proposed method."

The virus is mainly transmitted to humans via ticks and occasionally via the consumption of unpasteurized milk products. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control reported an increase in TBE incidence over the past years in Europe as well as the emergence of the disease in new areas. To better understand this phenomenon, we investigated the drivers of TBE emergence and increase in incidence in humans through an expert knowledge elicitation. We listed 59 possible drivers grouped in eight domains and elicited forty European experts to: (i) allocate a score per driver, (ii) weight this score within each domain, and (iii) weight the different domains and attribute an uncertainty level per domain. An overall weighted score per driver was calculated, and drivers with comparable scores were grouped into three terminal nodes using a regression tree analysis. The drivers with the highest scores were: (i) changes in human behavior/activities; (ii) changes in eating habits or consumer demand; (iii) changes in the landscape; (iv) influence of humidity on the survival and transmission of the pathogen; (v) difficulty to control reservoir(s) and/or vector(s); (vi) influence of temperature on virus survival and transmission; (vii) number of wildlife compartments/groups acting as reservoirs or amplifying hosts; (viii) increase of autochthonous wild mammals; and (ix) number of tick species vectors and their distribution.

The aim of this study is to explore the possibilities of using the Estonian Wikipedia for teaching purposes in general education schools. The study is based on semi-structured interviews with 49 teachers from 11 general education schools in Estonia. The results of the qualitative content analysis of the interviews indicate that teachers consider the use of Wikipedia to be a suitable for teaching, alongside other information sources and environments. However, teachers acknowledge some uncertainty and caution towards Wikipedia, as they do not consider it a very reliable teaching tool: an attitude largely inherited from the early days of Wikipedia. While teachers themselves are active and frequent Wikipedia users, and allow students to search for information, they do not assign Wikipedia-based text-creation tasks to students. The results of this study provide a basis for discussion about integrating Wikipedia into teaching in a way that is accessible, engaging, and inclusive for students."

In so doing, this study, through a constructivism-humanism approach, develops a theoretical 4-phase model by adding a trans-contextualisation learning phase to a literature-supported 3-stage science education teaching model. This enhanced model is put forward to enable science education to play a stronger role in impacting societal development towards building an active informed citizenry, enabling society to reflect on potential ways to meet its needs in moving towards a sustainable future. The study seeks science educator views familiar with the 3-stage teaching approach on the enhanced 4-phase model in terms of its value, feasibility and potential constraints. Such views are shown to be positive and aligned with the generally supportive views of teachers identified in a prior study."

A FEM-based solution of the tolerance analysis of an electrical machine can easily lead to a computationally expensive problem. Many papers have proposed the design of experiments, surrogate-model-based methodologies, to reduce the computational demand of this problem. However, these papers did not focus on the information loss and the limitations of the applied methodologies. Regardless, the absolute value of the calculated tolerance and the numerical error of the applied numerical methods can be in the same order of magnitude. In this paper, the tolerance and the sensitivity of BLDC machines' cogging torque are analysed using different methodologies. The results show that the manufacturing tolerances can have a significant effect on the calculated parameters, and that the mean value of the calculated cogging torque increases.

The PET scanner has a ring-shaped detector that surrounds the patient, which detects the gamma rays emitted by the tracer as it decays. Usually, these detectors are made up of scintillation crystals coupled to photodetectors that convert the light produced by the scintillation crystal into electrical signals. The Jagiellonian Positron Emission Mammograph (J-PEM) is the first J-PET prototype module based on a novel idea with a plastic scintillator and wavelength shifter (WLS). At the same time, it is a prototype module for the total-body J-PET system. 
J-PEM can be an effective system for the detection and diagnosis of breast cancer in its early stage by improving sensitivity. This can be achieved using superior timing properties of plastic scintillators and combined with the WLS sheets readout. In this paper, we present an application of the Geant4 program for simulating optical photon transport in the J-PEM module. We aim to study the light transport within scintillator bars and WLS sheets to optimize gamma-ray hit position resolution. We simulated a pencil beam of 511 keV photons impinging the scintillator bar at different locations. For each condition, we calculated the value of the pulse height centroid and the spread of the photon distribution. Some free parameters of the simulation, like the reflectivity and the effective attenuation length in the sheet, were determined from a comparison to experimental data. Finally, we estimate the influence of the application of WLS layer in the total-body J-PET on the scatter fraction.
To optimize the performance of the J-PEM module, we compared geometry with the number of WLS strips 50 and 83. It was found, that spatial resolution was 2.7 mm and 3.5 mm FWHM for 50 and 83 WLS strips respectively. Despite the better granularity, the 83-strip WLS geometry exhibits poorer resolution due to fewer photons being transmitted to the strip, resulting in large fluctuations of signal.

Such ash treatment promotes the revegetation of abandoned extracted peatlands. The aim of this study is to analyze the effect of wood ash (WA15 = 15 t ha‚àí1 and WA10 = 10 t ha‚àí1),oil shale ash (OSA8 = 8 t ha‚àí1), and a mixture of wood ash and oil shale ash (WA10 + OSA8) on the revegetation (vascular plants and bryophytes) of the Puhatu abandoned extracted peatland in NE Estonia. The following results were obtained: (1) The MRPP tests indicate that there are compositional
differences between the treatments. (2) Altogether, 23 vascular plant and 3 bryophyte species were recorded in the treatment areas. (3) Nine years after these ash treatments, the highest mean vascular plant species richness was recorded for WA15 (3.8 ¬± 0.3) and the lowest for OSA8 (2.0 ¬± 0.3). (4) A greater number of vascular plant species was observed in the WA15 area. (5) Mixed ash and wood ash had a significant effect on the amount of biomass in vascular plants. Treating with either wood ash or
a mixture of ash ensured the rapid formation of vascular plants and bryophyte layers, contributing to the restoration of the abandoned peatland ecosystem."

We evaluated serum levels and removal during haemodialysis and haemodiafiltration of tryptophan and tryptophan-derived uremic toxins, indoxyl sulfate (IS) and indole acetic acid (IAA), in ESKD patients in different dialysis treatment settings. This prospective multicentre study in four European dialysis centres enrolled 78 patients with ESKD. Blood and spent dialysate samples obtained during dialysis were analysed with high-performance liquid chromatography to assess uremic solutes, their reduction ratio (RR) and total removed solute (TRS). Mean free serum tryptophan and IS concentrations increased, and concentration of IAA decreased over pre-dialysis levels (67%, 49%, √¢ÀÜ‚Äô0.8%, respectively) during the first hour of dialysis. While mean serum total urea, IS and IAA concentrations decreased during dialysis (√¢ÀÜ‚Äô72%, √¢ÀÜ‚Äô39%, √¢ÀÜ‚Äô43%, respectively), serum tryptophan levels increased, resulting in negative RR (√¢ÀÜ‚Äô8%) towards the end of the dialysis session (p< 0.001), despite remarkable Trp losses in dialysate. RR and TRS values based on serum (total, free) and dialysate solute concentrations were lower for conventional low-flux dialysis (p< 0.001). High-efficiency haemodiafiltration resulted in 80% higher Trp losses than conventional low-flux dialysis, despite similar neutral Trp RR values. In conclusion, serum Trp concentrations and RR behave differently from uremic solutes IS, IAA and urea and Trp RR did not reflect dialysis Trp losses. Conventional low-flux dialysis may not adequately clear Trp-related uremic toxins while high efficiency haemodiafiltration increased Trp losses."

Recently, we developed a PL1 peptide (sequence: PPRRGLIKLKTS) for systemic targeting of malignant ECM. Here, we map the dynamics of PL1 binding to its receptors Fibronectin Extra Domain B (FN-EDB) and Tenascin C C-isoform (TNC-C) by computational modeling and cell-free binding studies on mutated receptor proteins, and study cellular binding and internalization of PL1 nanoparticles in cultured cells. Molecular dynamics simulation and docking analysis suggested that the engagement of PL1 peptide with both receptors is primarily driven by electrostatic interactions. Substituting acidic amino acid residues with neutral amino acids at predicted PL1 binding sites in FN-EDB (D52N-D49N-D12N) and TNC-C (D39N-D45N) resulted in the loss of binding of PL1 nanoparticles. Remarkably, PL1-functionalized nanoparticles (NPs) were not only deposited on the target ECM but bound the cells and initiated a robust cellular uptake via a pathway resembling macropinocytosis. Our studies establish the mode of engagement of the PL1 peptide with its receptors and suggest applications for intracellular delivery of nanoscale payloads. The outcomes of this work can be used for the development of PL1-derived peptides with improved stability, affinity, and specificity for precision targeting of the tumor ECM and malignant cells."

The use of lubricants to minimize friction, wear and flash temperature to prevent seizing is a common approach in engine tribology. However, the degradation of conventional liquid-based lubricants at temperatures beyond 300 √Ç¬∞C, in addition to its harmful effects on human and environmental health, is deeply concerning. Solid lubricants are a group of compounds exploiting the benefit of wear diminishing mechanisms over a wide range of operating temperatures. The materials incorporated with solid lubricants are herein called √¢‚Ç¨Àúself-lubricating' materials. Moreover, the possibility to omit the use of conventional liquid-based lubricants is perceived. The objective of the present paper is to review the current state-of-the-art in solid-lubricating materials operating under dry wear conditions. By opening with a brief summary of the understanding of solid lubrication at a high temperature, the article initially describes the recent developments in the field. The mechanisms of formation and the nature of tribo-films (or layers) during high-temperature wear are discussed in detail. The trends and ways of further development of the solid-lubricating materials and their future evolutions are identified."

While greenery is traditionally mapped top-down, alternative computational approaches have emerged for mapping greenery from the street level to mimic human sight. Despite the variety of these novel mapping approaches, it has remained unclear how well they reflect human perception in reality. We compared a range of both novel and traditional mapping methods with the self-reported perception of urban greenery at randomly selected study sites across Helsinki, the capital of Finland. The mapping methods included both image segmentation and point cloud-based methods to capture human perspective as well as traditional approaches taking the top-down perspective, i.e., land cover and remote sensing-based mapping methods. The results suggest that all the methods tested are strongly associated with the human perception of greenery at the street-level. However, mapped greenery values were consistently lower than the perceived values. Our results support the use of semantic image segmentation methods over color segmentation methods for greenery extraction to be closer to human perception. Point cloud-based approaches and top-down methods can be used as alternatives to image segmentation in case data coverage for the latter is limited. The results highlight a further research need for a comprehensive evaluation on how human perspective should be mimicked in different temporal and spatial conditions."

Children's narrative reflections about their experience were recorded immediately after tinkering. Across iterations of the program, changes to the exhibit design and facilitation provided by museum staff corresponded to increased families' engagement in key engineering practices. In the latter two cycles of the program, families engaged in the most testing, and in turn, redesigning. Further, in the latter cycles, the more children engaged in testing and retesting during tinkering, the more their narratives contained engineering-related content.

A detailed description of the physical mechanisms involved in vacuum arcing is yet to be achieved, despite extensive research. In this work, we further develop the modelling of the physical processes involved in the initiation of vacuum arcing, starting from field emission and leading to plasma onset. Our model concurrently combines particle-in-cell with Monte Carlo collisions (PIC-MCC) simulations of plasma processes with finite element-based calculations of electron emission and the associated thermal effects. Including the processes of evaporation, impact ionization and direct field ionization allowed us to observe the dynamics of plasma buildup from an initially cold cathode surface. We simulated a static nanotip at various local fields to study the thresholds for thermal runaway and plasma initiation, identifying the significance of various interactions. We found that direct field ionization of neutrals has a significant effect at high fields on the order of 10 GV/m. Furthermore, we find that cathode surface interactions such as evaporation, sputtering and bombardment heating play a major role in the initiation of vacuum arcs. Consequently, the inclusion of these interactions in vacuum arc simulations is imperative."

Therefore, the study aimed to produce lignocellulolytic enzymes from agro-industrial waste under solid-state fermentation (SSF) conditions and study their application in the clarification of pumpkin juice. The SSF was performed with three different combinations of wheat bran + rice bran (WBRB), wheat bran + wheat straw (WBWS), and rice bran + wheat straw (RBWS) as dry solid substrates (1:1) usingFusarium oxysporum(MTCC 7229). The protein, carboxymethyl cellulase (CMCase), and xylanase contents ranged from 0.98&3.90 mg/g, 5.89&6.84 U/g substrate, and 10.08&13.77 U/g substrate, respectively in different agro-industrial waste as substrates (WBRB, WBWS, RBWS, and control). The increase in enzyme concentration (0.50&2.40%) added to pumpkin juice exhibited an increased juice yield (16.30&55.60%), reduced browning index (1.03&0.70), and an increase in clarity (5.31&13.77 %T), which was further confirmed by a total variance of 84.83% by principal component analysis. Thus, the low-cost lignocellulolytic enzymes can be produced from agro-industrial waste that might have applications in food and beverage industries. Hence, this approach could be used as a long-term sustainable and circular source to valorize agro-industrial waste towards the greener future and the preservation of ecosystems."

This behavior is intrinsically linked to the time-dependent properties of concrete, encompassing both creep and shrinkage. Neglecting these aspects, especially when non-uniformly distributed, can give rise to various structural issues, including partition distress, overloading, and potential cracking in horizontal elements. This paper delves into the principal factors influencing vertical shortening and presents a rigorous approach to their evaluation, treating creep and shrinkage as critical parameters. The investigation employs two illustrative case studies: the first revolves around a 15-story reinforced concrete building with single columns supporting tributary areas at various levels, acting as a calibration case; the second encompasses a 30-story reinforced concrete structure employing a dual system, providing a broader perspective applicable to three-dimensional structures. A diverse array of analyses is conducted, incorporating considerations for concrete's linear and nonlinear behavior as well as the impact of construction stages. Our findings reveal that vertical shortening is directly proportional to the building's height and inversely related to concrete strength, longitudinal reinforcement ratios, member dimensions, volume-to-surface ratios, age of the structure upon load application, and relative humidity. Consequently, precise assessments of differential shortening effects are paramount. The utilization of staged construction analysis and time-dependent effects is recommended as the most suitable approach for evaluating vertical shortening effects."

Here, we studied the vertical variability of IOPs and simulated apparent optical properties (AOPs) in the Gulf of Finland (Baltic Sea) under three characteristic (non)stratification conditions. In the case of mixed water column, the vertical variability of optically significant constituents (OSC) and IOPs was relatively small. While in case of stratified water column the IOPs of surface layer were three times higher compared to the IOPs below the thermocline and the IOPs were strongly correlated with the physical parameters (temperature, salinity). Measurements of IOPs in stratified water column showed that the ratio of scattering (b(440)) to absorption (a(440)) changed under the thermocline (b(440)/a(440) < 1) i.e., absorption became the dominant component of attenuation under thermocline while the opposite is true for the upper layer. Simulated (from IOPs) spectral irradiance reflectance (R(√é¬ª)) and spectral diffuse attenuation coefficient (Kd(√é¬ª)) from deeper layers (below thermocline) have significantly smaller magnitude and smoother shape. This becomes relevant during upwelling events: a common process in the coastal Baltic Sea. We quantified the effect of upwelling on surface water properties using simulated AOPs. The simulated AOPs (from IOPs measurements) showed a decrease of the signal up to 68.8% and an increase of optical depth (z90(√é¬ª)) from 2.3 to 4.3 m in the green part of the spectrum in case upwelled water mass reaches the surface. In the coastal waters a vertical decrease ofKd(√é¬ª) in the PAR region (400&700 nm) by 6.8% (surface to 20 m depth) was observed, while vertical decrease of chlorophyll-a(Chl-a) and total suspended matter (TSM) was 31.7 and 42.1%, respectively. The ratioR(490)/R(560)√¢‚Ä∞¬•0.77 indicates also the upwelled water mass. The study showed that upwelling is a process that, in addition to biological activity, horizontal transport of OSC, and temperature changes, alters the optical signal of surface water measured by a remote sensor. Knowledge about the vertical variability of IOPs and AOPs relation to upwelling can help the parametrisation of remote sensing algorithms for retrieving water quality estimates in the coastal regions."

This paper proposes a process mining approach to decompose observed waiting times in each activity transition into multiple direct causes and to analyze the impact of each identified cause on the process cycle time efficiency. The approach is implemented as a software tool called Kronos that process analysts can use to upload event logs and obtain analysis results of waiting time causes. The proposed approach was empirically evaluated using synthetic event logs to verify its ability to discover different direct causes of waiting times. The applicability of the approach is demonstrated in a real-life process. Interviews with process mining experts confirm that Kronos is useful and easy to use for identifying improvement opportunities

All foamable compositions had viscosities of approximately 7000 cSt and curing times below 2 min, allowing for quick dispensing and sufficient time for the foam to cure in semi-industrial volumes."

Distinction is made between two-body and three-body abrasion, solid-particle erosion, and slurry erosion. Cermets, in particular TiC-, Ti(C,N)- and Cr3C2-based composites and hardmetals, are compared for their abrasive and erosive wear performance and mechanism. The review enabled formulation of tribological conditions in which cermets may be comparable or have potential to outperform WC-Co hardmetals. Hardmetals, in general, outperform cermets in abrasion and solid-particle erosion at room and moderate temperatures. However, cermets demonstrate their potential mainly in severe conditions: at elevated temperatures and corrosive (oxidation, electrochemical corrosion) environments."

Vibration motors, and especially the possibility of creating the sensation of moving touch on the skin through those, seemed having the greatest potential in terms of the effect delivered and the readiness of the off-the-shelf technology. A first rough prototype was created to communicate the idea of vibration moving along the garment's inside. It was a flat rectangle textile with a line of vibration motors sewn on it. This was the fastest way to have a tangible proof of concept in order to lead the discovery process further. By sensing the vibration moving on different parts of the body, we decided to build the first prototype (Figure 1) with more lines of vibration motors. This one could be used similarly on different parts of the body, but also to create a sleeve to try out the moving sensation when it surrounds a whole limb. When creating the prototype, we used the haptic metaphor of motion, like an insect moving through the surface of the body or being under the shower or under a waterfall. But how to create a sensation of air, water or other perceived substance flowing inside of one's body through such motion patterns?"

We employed time series of zooplankton and environmental parameters that were measured monthly during 38√Ç¬†years in a large, shallow eutrophic lake in Estonia to build estimates of zooplankton community metrics (cladocerans, copepods, rotifers, ciliates). The analysis of historical time series revealed that air temperature was by far the most important variable for explaining zooplankton biomass and abundance, followed, in decreasing order of importance, by pH, phytoplankton biomass and nitrate concentration. Models constructed with the best predicting variables explained up to 71% of zooplankton biomass variance. Most of the predictive variables had opposing or antagonistic interactions, often mitigating the effect of temperature. In the second part of the study, three future climate scenarios were developed following different Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) temperature projections and entered into an empirical model. Simulation results showed that only a scenario in which air temperature stabilizes would curb total metazooplankton biomass and abundance. In other scenarios, metazooplankton biomass and abundance would likely exceed historical ranges whereas ciliates would not expand. Within the metazooplankton community, copepods would increase in biomass and abundance, whereas cladocerans would lose in biomass but not in abundance. These changes in the zooplankton community will have important consequences for lake trophic structure and ecosystem functioning."

To examine the role of family relationships, we analyzed the responses from 13,009 participants in 50 societies on their life satisfaction across societies varying in their levels of historical and contemporary cultural heterogeneity. Such heterogeneity creates differences in the frequency of interacting with unfamiliar groups, which leads families to become more central to their members' satisfaction with life. Multi-level analyses showed that historical and contemporary cultural heterogeneity moderated the pattern such that greater historical or contemporary cultural heterogeneity of society promoted a stronger positive relation between family relationship satisfaction and individual life satisfaction. Our results also revealed that the moderating role of historical cultural heterogeneity was more reliable than that of contemporary cultural heterogeneity. These findings demonstrate the importance of societal demography in shaping people's psychological processes in different historical periods, suggesting a universal, trans-historical cultural process."

Stronger agricultural intensification at the field level (agrochemicals use, ploughing frequency) favors the assembly of shorter-lived communities and bird species with smaller relative brain sizes.

Agricultural intensification reduces the taxonomic diversity of bird communities, but its influence on functional diversity has been less studied. Here, we analyze the response of functional diversity of different cereal farmland bird communities across Europe to a gradient of agricultural intensification. We collected bibliographical information on life history traits (i.e. body mass, brain size, age of sexual maturity, clutch size, number of clutches, lifespan) of 30 species of birds recorded during field surveys in eight European countries. The index ""brood value"" was calculated to know each species‚Äô level of reproductive investment per clutch. Intensification gradients at two spatial scales were obtained from field data through PCA, related to management practices at the field scale and the variation in structure and composition of farmland at the landscape scale respectively. We calculated the functional diversity index (FD) and the community-weighted mean (CWM) for each trait and sampling area, and linear mixed models in relation to the two intensification gradients were performed. Results showed that stronger intensification at the field level favors the assembly of shorter-lived communities and bird species with smaller relative brain sizes, also decreasing overall trait diversity. It also restricts the range of strategies for parental investment, reducing the functional diversity of the brood value index. More intensive field management would favor bird communities dominated by generalist and even introduced and/or managed hunting species, while putting at risk those farmland- and grassland-adapted species, typically more associated with the provision of ecosystem services. This highlights the relevance of field management (agrochemicals use, ploughing frequency) for the functional composition of bird communities and the conservation of farmland biodiversity. These findings add to existing knowledge on how species‚Äô pace of life and cognitive capacity interact with drivers of global change, such as agricultural intensification."

We showed that the groups in our sample can be divided into two main classes: 
high-luminosity rich groups and clusters, and low-luminosity poor groups.
In rich clusters BGGs  are red and quenched galaxies, 
while in poor groups only 40- 60$% of BGGs are red and quenched, 
and the rest of the BGGs are star-forming, either blue or red. 
Rich groups and clusters are located in global high-density regions in filaments, 
while poor groups reside everywhere in the cosmic web. 
Our results suggest that group and cluster properties are modulated by 
their location in the cosmic web, but the properties of their BGGs are mostly

One of the best rules for the heuristic parameter choice is the quasi-optimality criterion where the parameter is chosen as the global minimizer of the quasi-optimality function. In some problems this rule fails. We prove that one of the local minimizers of the quasi-optimality function is always a good regularization parameter. For the choice of the proper local minimizer we propose to construct the Q-curve which is the analogue of the L-curve, but on thex-axis we use modified discrepancy instead of discrepancy and on they-axis the quasi-optimality function instead of the norm of the approximate solution. In the area rule we choose for the regularization parameter such local minimizer of the quasi-optimality function for which the area of the polygon, connecting on Q-curve this minimum point with certain maximum points, is maximal. We also provide a posteriori error estimates of the approximate solution, which allows to check the reliability of the parameter chosen heuristically. Numerical experiments on an extensive set of test problems confirm that the proposed rules give much better results than previous heuristic rules. Results of proposed rules are comparable with results of the discrepancy principle and the monotone error rule, if the last two rules use the exact noise level."

Such a theory can be motivated by Palatini\(R+R^2\)modified gravity. Assuming a runaway inflaton potential, we take the Universe to become dominated by the kinetic energy density of the scalar field after inflation. Initially, the leading kinetic term is quartic and we call the corresponding period hyperkination. Subsequently, the usual quadratic kinetic term takes over and we have regular kination, until reheating. We study, both analytically and numerically, the spectrum of primordial gravitational waves generated during inflation and re-entering the horizon during the subsequent eras. We demonstrate that the spectrum is flat for modes re-entering during radiation domination and hyperkination and linear in frequency for modes re-entering during kination: kinetic domination boosts the spectrum, but hyperkination truncates its peak. As a result, the effects of the kinetic period can be extended to observable frequencies without generating excessive gravitational waves, which could otherwise destabilise the process of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. We show that there is ample parameter space for the primordial gravitational waves to be observable in the near future. If observed, the amplitude and √¢‚Ç¨Àúknee' of the spectrum will provide valuable insights into the background theory."

The adopted set of variables can clearly distinguish between different asymptotic states as fixed points, including the kinetic and inflationary regimes. The key role in the description of inflation is played by the heteroclinic orbits that run from the asymptotic saddle points to the late time attractor point and are approximated by nonminimal slow roll conditions. To seek the asymptotic fixed points, we outline a heuristic method in terms of the √¢‚Ç¨≈ìeffective potential√¢‚Ç¨¬ù and √¢‚Ç¨≈ìeffective mass√¢‚Ç¨¬ù, which can be applied for any nonminimally coupled theories. As particular examples, we study positive quadratic nonminimal couplings with quadratic and quartic potentials and note how the portraits differ qualitatively from the known scalar-curvature counterparts. For quadratic models, inflation can only occur at small nonminimal coupling to torsion, as for larger coupling, the asymptotic de Sitter saddle point disappears from the physical phase space. Teleparallel models with quartic potentials are not viable for inflation at all, since for small nonminimal coupling, the asymptotic saddle point exhibits weaker than exponential expansion, and for larger coupling, it also disappears."

Leaf developmental categories contribute to the top-of-canopy reflectance and should be considered when taking ground truth for remote sensing studies (RS). Deciduous tree species,Betula pendula,Populus tremula, andAlnus incana, were sampled from May to October 2018 in an Estonian hemiboreal forest. Chlorophyll and carotenoid content were detected biochemically; leaf anatomical traits (leaf, palisade, and spongy mesophyll thickness) were measured on leaf cross-sections; leaf reflectance was measured by a spectroradiometer with an integrating sphere (350&2500 nm). Biophysical and anatomical leaf traits were related to 64 vegetation indices (VIs). Linear models based on VIs for all tested leaf traits were more robust if both juvenile and mature leaves were included. This study provides information on which VIs are interchangeable or independent. Pigment and leaf thickness sensitive indices formed PC1; water and structural trait related VIs formed an independent group associated with PC3. Type of growth and leaf age could affect the validation of biophysical and anatomical leaf trait retrieval from the optical signal. It is, therefore, necessary to sample both leaf developmental categories: young and mature: in RS, especially if sampling is only once within the vegetation season."

Analysis of survey results reveals that according to Russian-speakers, among their favourite topics were everyday life, sex- and family-related matters. Visual humour was the most popular form. Respondents mentioned social media as the primary way of sharing humour, but oral transmission remained important as well. The language of the shared humour was primarily Russian, and the content was mainly not specific to the Estonian cultural context. As humorous vernacular expression offers insights into the mechanisms of identity-building and integration, the choice of language and of source can be interpreted as a way to create and maintain a local identity.

For smooth, positive definite Finsler metrics, this important theorem states that, if the metric is of Berwald type (i.e., its Chern&Rund connection defines an affine connection on the underlying manifold), then it is affinely equivalent to a Riemann space, meaning that its affine connection is the Levi&Civita connection of some Riemannian metric. We show for the first time that this result does not extend to general Finsler spacetimes. More precisely, we find a large class of Berwald spacetimes for which the Ricci tensor of the affine connection is not symmetric. The fundamental difference from positive definite Finsler spaces that makes such an asymmetry possible is the fact that generally, Finsler spacetimes satisfy certain smoothness properties only on a proper conic subset of the slit tangent bundle. Indeed, we prove that when the Finsler Lagrangian is smooth on the entire slit tangent bundle, the Ricci tensor must necessarily be symmetric. For large classes of Finsler spacetimes, however, the Berwald property does not imply that the affine structure is equivalent to the affine structure of a pseudo-Riemannian metric. Instead, the affine structure is that of a metric-affine geometry with vanishing torsion."

All bioretention mesocosms, irrespective of treatment, were efficient in reducing water volume, flow and pollution level. There was no phytotoxic effect of NaCl on plants, even at the highest NaCl concentration tested. Water volume reduction and flow rate were influenced by plant species, but salt concentration had no effect. Salt runoffs significantly increased the removal of some metals, such as Cr, Ni, Pb and Zn, but had no effect on nutrient removal. Because snowmelt laden with de-icing salt is of short duration and occurs during plant dormancy, plants in bioretention may be less affected by de-icing salt than previously thought, provided that salinity decreases rapidly to normal level in the soil water. The long-term effects of de-icing salt and general performance of bioretention should be further studied under full-scale conditions."

We find support for an alternative tribe corresponding to theCloeophoromyia&Asindulumgenus group, but a tribal reclassification of the Keroplatinae is left for future studies. The genusHeteropternaSkuse, 1888 is considered as identical withCtenoceridionMatile, 1972 syn. nov."

By making use of the completeness relation for the flavor wave functions of the ground state baryon\(\mathbf{20'}\)representation we are able to rewrite the results of the current algebra approach in terms of the seven topological tensor invariants describing the decays. The representation of the current algebra results in terms of topological tensor invariants depends only on the initial and final state of the process. The summation over intermediate states inherent to the current algebra result is automatically taken care of in the tensor representation. In this way one arrives at a new, quick and very compact assessment of the results of the current algebra/pole model calculation. For example, one can quickly identify the decays in which the p.v.S-wave amplitude is predicted to vanish implying zero polarization asymmetries in these decays. We provide tables of the values of the seven topological tensor invariants for all Cabibbo favored and singly and doubly Cabibbo suppressed nonleptonic single and double charm baryon decays. In total we treat 196 charm baryon decays. We also discuss the charm preserving\(\Delta C=0\)decays of single charm baryons and the usual hyperon decays."

The framework relies on the indirect modulation of reheating, which is implemented without any direct coupling between the spectator field and the inflaton and does not require non-renormalisable interactions. The scenario gives rise to local non-Gaussianity with\(f_{\mathrm{NL}}\simeq 5\)as the typical signal. As an example model where the indirect modulation mechanism is realised for the Higgs boson, we study the Standard Model extended with right-handed neutrinos. For the Standard Model running we find, however, that the scenario analysed does not seem to produce the observed perturbation."

By itself, this is a justification of the canonicity of this model of concurrency. However, the universal property is itself of interest, being a formal demonstration of the relationship between feedback and state. Indeed,feedbackcategories, also originally proposed by Katis, Sabadini and Walters, are a weakening of traced monoidal categories, with various applications in computer science. Astate bootstrappingtechnique, which has appeared in several different contexts, yieldsfreesuch categories. We show that\({\textbf{Span}}({\textbf{Graph}})_*\)arises in this way, being the free feedback category over\({\textbf{Span}}(\textbf{Set})\). Given that the latter can be seen as an algebra of predicates, the algebra of open transition systems thus arises: roughly speaking: as the result of bootstrapping state to that algebra. Finally, we generalize feedback categories endowing state spaces with extra structure: this extends the framework from mere transition systems to automata with initial and final states."

These theories have in common that, in addition to the tetrad or metric, they employ a flat connection as additional field variable, but dthey iffer by the presence of absence of torsion and nonmetricity for this independent connection. Besides the different underlying geometric formulation using a tetrad or metric as fundamental field variable, one has different choices to introduce the conditions of vanishing curvature, torsion, and nonmetricity, either by imposing them a priori and correspondingly restricting the variation of the action when the field equations are derived, or by using Lagrange multipliers. Special care must be taken, since these conditions form non-holonomic constraints. Here, we explicitly show that all of the aforementioned approaches are equivalent, and that the same set of field equations is obtained, independently of the choice of the geometric formulation and variation procedure. We further discuss the consequences arising from the diffeomorphism invariance of the gravitational action, and show how they establish relations between the gravitational field equations."

The theories only differ by a boundary term. The equivalence was proven, both by using perturbation theory and Hamiltonian analysis. It is further shown how one can construct novel bigravity theories within the teleparallel framework. Some of those are analyzed through perturbation theory, and it is found that all of the considered novel bigravity theories suffer from pathologies. In particular, it is found that a construction with two copies of new general relativity leads to ghostly degrees of freedom which are not present in the single tetrad teleparallel corresponding theory. We demonstrate how the teleparallel framework allows to easily create theories with derivative interaction. However, it is shown through perturbation theory that the simplest model is not viable. Furthermore, we demonstrate some steps in the Hamiltonian analysis of teleparallel bigravity with two copies of new general relativity and some toy models. The results rule out some of the novel teleparallel bigravity theories, but also demonstrate techniques in perturbation theory and Hamiltonian analysis which could be further used for more profound theories in the future."

Moreover, this haplogroup parallels the genome-wide genetic ancestry of hunter-gatherers from the Iranian Plateau and the Caucasus. We characterized two L1-M22 harboring population groups during the Early Holocene. One expanded with the West Asian Neolithic transition. The other moved to South Asia ‚àº8-6 kya but showed no expansion. This group likely participated in the spread of Dravidian languages. These South Asian L1-M22 lineages expanded ‚àº4-3 kya, coinciding with the Steppe ancestry introduction.

In seeking to address this limitation, this study undertakes a systematically literature review of research articles published between 2011-2022, within the scope of trans-disciplinarity at school level science education. The 5 key transdisciplinary attributes are identified as - complexity, liberation, inclusion, transcendence beyond education and reflection, leading to the identification of 12 key dimensions of trans-disciplinarity. Based on this finding, a model is put forward with respect to implementing trans-disciplinarity within school level science teaching-learning, incorporating all identified dimensions as an approach towards addressing wicked problems within the society. The significance of this study lies on the conceptualisation of trans-disciplinarity in a holistic sense, so as to address a wider societal development through school science education."

In nature, where the possibilities of power increase are limited, efficiency of motion is particularly important; the same principle can be applied to the emerging biomimetic and bio-interacting technologies. In this work, by applying hints from nature, we consider possible approaches of increasing the efficiency of motion through liquid medium of bilayer ionic electroactive polymer actuations, focusing on the reduction of friction by means of surface tension and hydrophobicity. Conducting polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bilayers were chosen as the model actuator system. The actuation medium consisted of aqueous solutions containing tetramethylammonium chloride and sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate in different ratios. The roles of ion concentrations and the surface tension are discussed. Hydrophobicity of the PET support layer was further tuned by adding a spin-coated silicone layer to it. As expected, both approaches increased the displacement: the best results having been obtained by combining both, nearly doubling the bending displacement. The simple approaches for greatly increasing actuation motion efficiency can be used in any actuator system operating in a liquid medium."

Previously, research practice in this area has been more concerned with investigating the relationship between individual negative emotions and WTC. However, insufficient attention has been given to a wide range of positive and negative emotions contributing to WTC. This study aims to address the impact of emotions (positive and negative) and self-perceived communication competence (SPCC) on WTC in an L2 in the context of Pakistan. The broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions has driven theoretical reasoning. Higher education students (N = 401) were considered the participants of this study and were approached conveniently. Data were processed and analyzed in SPSS. The findings revealed that positive emotions and SPCC positively influence WTC in an L2. On the contrary, negative emotions have a negative impact on WTC in an L2. Additionally, SPCC appears to be a significant moderator in the relationship between emotions (positive and negative) and WTC in an L2. The study's findings have important practical implications for Pakistan's Higher Education Commission (HEC) in drafting and implementing policies to enhance students' WTC within higher education classrooms."

The near future promises more and more detailed information about the observable black holes and black hole candidates. This information could lead to important advances on constraints on or evidence for modifications of general relativity. More precisely, we are studying the influence of weak teleparallel perturbations on general relativistic vacuum spacetime geometries in spherical symmetry. We find the most general family of spherically symmetric, static vacuum solutions of the theory, which are candidates for describing teleparallel black holes which emerge as perturbations to the Schwarzschild black hole. We compare our findings to results on black hole or static, spherically symmetric solutions in teleparallel gravity discussed in the literature, by comparing the predictions for classical observables such as the photon sphere, the perihelion shift, the light deflection, and the Shapiro delay. On the basis of these observables, we demonstrate that among the solutions we found, there exist spacetime geometries that lead to much weaker bounds on teleparallel gravity than those found earlier. Finally, we move on to a discussion of how the teleparallel perturbations influence the Hawking evaporation in these spacetimes."

This paper presents a global overview of urban data sources and structures used to train machine learning (ML) algorithms integrated into urban planning decision support systems (DSS). It contributes to a common understanding of choosing the right urban data for a given urban planning issue, i.e., their type, source and structure, for more efficient use in training ML models. For the purpose of this study, we conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) of all relevant peer-reviewed studies available in the Scopus database. More precisely, 248 papers were found to be relevant with their further analysis using a text-mining approach to determine (a) the main urban data sources used for ML modeling, (b) the most popular approaches used in relevant urban planning and urban problem-solving studies and their relationship to the type of data source used, and (c) the problems commonly encountered in their use. After classifying them, we identified the strengths and weaknesses of data sources depending on several predefined factors. We found that the data mainly come from two main categories of sources, namely (1) sensors and (2) statistical surveys, including social network data. They can be classified as (a) opportunistic or (b) non-opportunistic depending on the process of data acquisition, collection, and storage. Data sources are closely correlated with their structure and potential urban planning issues to be addressed. Almost all urban data have an indexed structure and, in particular, either attribute tables for statistical survey data and data from simple sensors (e.g., climate and pollution sensors) or vectors, mostly obtained from satellite images after large-scale spatio-temporal analysis. The paper also provides a discussion of the potential opportunities, emerging issues, and challenges that urban data sources face and should overcome to better catalyze intelligent/smart planning. This should contribute to the general understanding of the data, their sources and the challenges to be faced and overcome by those seeking data and integrating them into smart applications and urban-planning processes."

This study aimed to understand the interplay between cultural ecosystem services (CESs) and residents' well-being. Aligned with the EU Nature Restoration Law, this research explored long-term dynamics in peri-urban areas' CES conservation. The methodology included creating scenarios by combining new secondary data with the author's prior studies, which covered landscape belts, CES values, and residents' perceptions of satisfaction with the environment and recreation opportunities collected through a municipal survey. While residents expressed satisfaction in coastal and green spaces, a distinct decline was evident near villages with industrial and agricultural features, highlighting the landscape's impact on well-being. This study identified case-study-specific threats related to rapid urbanisation and put forward constructive policy recommendations. The goal was to develop effective and sustainable strategies for preserving nature through ecosystem service-based frameworks, enhance community well-being, and account for landscape dynamics through scenario planning."

In this study, we applied high-throughput sequencing technologies (HTS) to perform a virus survey on symptomatic plants from 47 cereal fields in Estonia. HTS allowed the assembly of complete genome sequences for 22 isolates of cereal yellow dwarf virus RPS, barley yellow dwarf virus GAV, barley yellow dwarf virus PAS (BYDV-PAS), barley yellow dwarf virus PAV (BYDV-PAV), and barley yellow dwarf virus OYV (BYDV-OYV). We also assembled a near-complete genome of the putative novel species BYDV-OYV from Swedish samples of meadow fescue. Previously, partial sequencing of the central part of the coat protein gene indicated that BYDV-OYV represented a putative new species closely related to BYDV-PAV-CN, which currently is recognized as a subtype of BYDV-PAV. The present study found that whereas the 3√¢‚Ç¨¬≤gene block of BYDV-OYV shares the closest relationship with BYDV-PAV-CN, the 5√¢‚Ç¨¬≤gene block of BYDV-OYV shows the closest relationships to that of BYDV-PAS. Recombination detection analysis revealed that BYDV-OYV is a parental virus for both. Analysis of complete genome sequence data indicates that both BYDV-OYV and BYDV-PAV-CN meet the species criteria of genusLuteovirus. The study discusses BYDV phylogeny, and through a systematicin silicoanalysis of published primers for YDV detection, the existing gaps in current diagnostic practices for detection of YDVs, proposing primer pairs based on the most recent genomic information for the detection of different BYDV species. Thanks to the rising number of sequences available in databases, continuous updating of diagnostic primers can improve test specificity, e.g., inclusivity and exclusivity at species levels. This is needed to properly survey the geographical and host distribution of the different species of the YDV complex and their prevalence in cereal/barley yellow dwarf disease epidemics."

The example data comes from a university-level course on Spanish linguistics, where Spanish was a third or subsequent language for the participants. Evidently, the vast majority of their external activity was language-related and brief, and, interestingly, a great part of it recurs to a lingua franca, English. Some social context and reasoning is offered to explain such an observation."
