2024,Kaarel Sikk (Author),Framing settlement systems as spatial adaptive systems,Complex adaptive systems | Complexity | Locational modelling | Residential location choice | Settlement systems | Social-ecological systems,," Theoretical developments are needed to interpret the increasing amount of large-scale spatial data about past settlements. So far, settlement patterns have mostly been considered as passive imprints of past human activities and most theories are limited to ecological processes. Locational and spatial interactions have scarcely been included as long-term driving forces of settlement systems but hold promise to explain large-scale patterns. This paper proposes a conceptual model for long-term spatial adaptive settlement systems based on the complex adaptive systems framework and both spatial and cross-scale interactions. The goal of the model is to find new ways of interpreting archaeological location data and understand settlement systems as emerging from micro-choices of population units interacting in space. The conceptualisation is carried out on a level that it can be used to bridge hunter-gatherer and urban theories. We first describe settlement patterns based on concepts from archaeological locational studies and social-ecological systems. Second, we identify the abstract spatial and aspatial entities of the system and describe the potential relations between them. Using knowledge from previous research, we then map both empirically observable and abstract system entities and predict links between them in order to come up with an overarching conceptual framework. The system is based on residential choice mechanisms and exposes several cross-scale feedback loops between the micro-level choices and the settlement system emerging at the meso-level. We finally argue that the proposed adaptive settlement system framework has the potential to bring new insights into long-term processes, especially through dynamic spatial simulation, and at the same time, provides an interpretational framework for archaeological records and empirical spatial analysis. Examples of its applications in archaeological research are introduced."

This type of humorous poetry in the Baltic provinces was created by Baltic German authors, who were fluent in proper German and found entertainment in ridiculing the grammatically incorrect use of German language of so-called Half-Germans (Estonians and Latvians who wanted to claim German identity). The most long-living and viable character of Half-German poetry has been Schanno von Dinakant, a fictional Half-German hero, who appeared in several works before World War I. Later, Schanno crystallized as a poet-philosopher in the role of a folkloric alter ego of Baltic Germans with his identity during and after World War II, revealing a humorous-melancholic farewell to the declining Baltic German community, which had lost their natural habitat in the Baltic States."
2023,Anu Adamson (Author); Kenneth Tuul (Author),"Alkyl Dicarbonates, Common Electrolyte Degradation Products, Can Enable Long-Lived Li-Ion Cells at High Temperatures",,,"A common degradation product dimethyl-2,5-dioxahexane carboxylate (DMOHC) produced in Li-ion cell electrolytes after ageing is used here as an electrolyte solvent, allowing Li-ion cells to operate at high temperatures (70 °C and 85 °C) with excellent capacity retention and low impedance growth. Viscosity and conductivity values are reported for various DMOHC and diethyl-2,5- dioxahexane carboxylate (DEOHC) blends with dimethyl carbonate (DMC) and diethyl carbonate (DEC). Charge-discharge cycling data are reported for LiFePO4/graphite (LFP), Li[Ni0.5Mn0.3Co0.2]O2/graphite (NMC3.8 V, balanced for 3.8 V cut-off), Li[Ni0.6Mn0.4Co00]O2/graphite (NMC640, balanced for 4.1 V cut-off) and Li[Ni0.83Mn0.06Co0.11]O2/graphite (Ni83, balanced for 4.06 V cut-off) pouch cells at 70 °C and 85 °C. Pouch cells with DMOHC electrolyte have extraordinarily long lifetimes at 70 °C and 85 °C Pouch cells containing DMOHC-based electrolytes produce little to no gas compared to traditional ethylene carbonate (EC) based electrolytes. Cells taken apart after testing showed uniform negative electrode lithiation and no differences in the cell components were observed when using DMOHC electrolytes compared to EC. Lastly, micro X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy analysis was performed to probe the degree of transition metal deposition on negative electrodes of cycled cells. Very low levels of transition metals were found on the negative electrode even for cells tested at 85 °C. DMOHC is a co-solvent that can enable Li-ion batteries with exceptional high temperature lifetimes."
2023,Dmytro Khutkyy (Author),"Internet voting for open government: what, why, and how to introduce it in local communities",,,"A number of local communities in Europe have introduced elements of transparency, participation, and accountability in their municipalities. Still, given the abundance of available data and civic engagement forms, there is always a potential for further development. This is especially promising with the help of the open government framework that encourages the introduction of innovative and digital technologies. One notable tool is internet voting (i-voting) since it is able to empower people with a more direct and influential voice in local policy making. Thereby, this paper suggests some concepts and models of open government and i-voting, provides several examples, outlines preconditions, discusses risks, and offers recommendations for introducing i-voting and enhancing open government. This brief is designed as a source of ideas for advancing open government and i-voting in local communities."
2022,Vaike Raudava (Author),Challenges of Accountability: The Case of Post-Soviet Estonian Rural Local Governments,,"Estonia, accountability; rural local government, social work practice.","Accountability in social work is carried out in two dimensions, in the interaction between professionalism and social work practice. The aim of this research is to explore administrative social work accountability in Estonian rural local governments. The utilized methodology has been the collective case study (Mills 2010; Punch 2009). I followed the information-oriented selection: the cases of maximum variation by size and location (Frankfort-Nachmias  Nachmias 1996). Triangulation has been used as a procedure for acquiring data. Further analysis was conducted by using a taxonomic approach (Ragin 2011). The lack of national regulation with an insufficient understanding of social work has affected the local governments‟ ability to choose the best of the available opinions. An agreement has been missing as to how the local government shares responsibility with the State and the families. In the current situation, the responsibilities of each of the parties are not specified. The situation is unclear- who is actually the client of the rural local government? The local-centered approach makes the local government‟s social work practice politically loaded. In the future, however, the model of an independent professional social worker and of the recipient being the most important participant of the service provider system should prevail."
2024,Mari Karm (Author); Triinu Soomere (Author),PhD Students’ Transformative Change in Teaching: A Comparative Case Study,,,"As future academics, Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) students are be expected to employ learning-centred approach as stated in the Paris Communique (2018) by the European ministers of education. The limited research available about doctoral students’ conceptions indicates that they range from content- to learning-centred. Although a few studies explored the factors which prompt students’ transformation of conceptions and approach, none specifically focused on PhD students. This comparative case study explored how PhD students describe the transformation in their teaching conceptions and approach towards learning-centredness, and the context surrounding it. The results indicated that participants described the transformation through the gaining of theoretical teaching-related knowledge, being related to dissatisfaction with their own teaching, the application of a learning-centred approach, and time. The teaching–learning context was described mostly as supportive but not always allowing the implementation of transformation. Results suggest that discourse is needed to facilitate critical reflection leading to transformative learning."

2020,Vaike Raudava (Author),The Challenges from Post-Soviet Social Work in the Small Rural Local Governments: Estonian Case in the Period 1995 - 2015,,"Local Government, Social Work, Practice, Post-Soviet, Estonia.","Contemporary European social work is based on the principle of collective responsibility, human rights and social justice. The IFSW (International Federation of Social Workers) declared that social work was, and always will be, a human rights occupation. “The European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights” was approved by the European Parliament on November 29th, 2007 (2007/2218 (ACI), and sets out rights, freedoms, and principles. Sohlberg [1] has commented that the fundamental rights are individual rights, independent of the identity of the beneficiary. However, the ability of a person to cope with his/her life independently is, for Europe, very important. The utilized methodology has been the collective case study according to Mills [2]. I followed the information-oriented selection: the cases of maximum variation by size and location [3]. Triangulation has been used as a procedure for acquiring data. Further analysis was conducted by using the complementary configurations according to Ragin [4]. According to the research findings, there has been tension between the fundamental rights of citizenship and social work practice. Analysed the availability, there could find the several risk groups, who are legally excluded from the local social work (welfare) system (long-term unemployed, person who cares for one's relatives). The responsibility for the care of a person during his or her long-term care, illness, or profound disability lies solely on the family. In the dominant practice, the local government supports only single (older) people, the decision-makers are according to “Estonian Family Law Act” [5], which gives the order of care to families first. This is the basis for giving and receiving social assistance and providing the social services such as home care services or institutional care services. Social work focuses on the needs of people, with a primary nature requiring that they be dealt with as part of mandatory laws. The actual challenge of Estonian public discussion should be how to ensure the fundamental right of every citizen to receive government support from a local government in the case of the need and in addition to the list of laws compulsory for all."

2024,Anna Aret (Author); Anni Kasikov (Author); Indrek Kolka (Author); Tõnis Eenmäe (Author); Vitalii Checha (Author),Yellow hypergiant V509 Cas: Stable in the ‘yellow void’,,methods: observational / stars: atmospheres / stars: evolution / stars: massive / stars: individual: HR 8752 / supergiants,"Context. The yellow hypergiant star V509 Cas is currently undergoing an extreme phase of evolution. Having experienced eruptive mass-loss outbursts in the 20th century, the star’s effective temperature reached record high values in the early 2000s. However, since then, the star’s behaviour has displayed an unprecedented level of stability. In spite of that, the star could be traversing through the ‘yellow void’ instability region.

Aims. To describe the current evolutionary state of V509 Cas, we analysed its variability using photometric and spectroscopic data collected over recent years. By comparing our findings with historical records, we aim to determine whether the star’s surface shows signs of stabilisation. Additionally, we investigate the variability of emission components in the wings of certain spectral lines to highlight the contribution of the circumstellar gaseous disc to this phenomenon.

Methods. Our spectroscopic monitoring observations were carried out at Tartu Observatory over the course of seven years, supplemented by echelle spectra obtained at the Nordic Optical Telescope, as well as publicly available photometric data from Gaia, AAVSO, and AAVSO’s Bright Star Monitor programme. We estimated the variability of effective temperature and radial velocity from the spectral time series and correlated it with the brightness variability of V509 Cas.

Results. The results indicate that the star’s average brightness level has remained stable throughout the observed period, with an amplitude of variability ∼0.1 mag. While the amplitude of short-term temperature fluctuations has decreased compared to the early 2000s, the variability of the radial velocity remains similar to historical values from the early 20th century. Moreover, we show how the variable radial velocity affects the emission components in some absorption lines (e.g. Sc II) and how that follows the hypothesis of a disc surrounding the star."
2022,Bogdan Romanov (Author),Similar yet so different: The analysis of factors explaining the variance in COVID-19 deaths across the Baltic and Nordic states1,,"Covid-19, Nordic countries, Baltic states, policy effectiveness, QCA","Despite the fact that the global community has lived with COVID-19 for more than two years, the highly advanced Baltic and Nordic states are still overlooked in both a theoretical and empirical sense. Additionally, these neighboring regions show significant variance in the total number of deaths caused by the coronavirus. The higher value of the total number of deaths in the Baltic states is explained by a higher number of COVID-19 cases, a relatively lower value of GDP per capita, a higher share of elderly citizens, and what might be the essential factor — a lower level of trust by citizens in their national governments. The general conclusion is that the effectiveness of coronavirus policies is undermined by an absence of trust in governmental decision-making.

Mosses are good indicators of air pollution. In Estonia, heavy metals have been measured from Pleurozium schreberi and Hylocomium splendens, which do not grow in areas of Tallinn with a higher pollution load. In the present study, Cu, Fe and Cd were measured from five moss species growing in contaminated as well less polluted areas of Tallinn. Based on stationary and street pollution source inventory and air pollution dispersion modelling, the long-term average concentrations of fine particles (PM10) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) in air were estimated. The work revealed that it is possible to find a moss species that is common in Tallinn and grows in both polluted and less polluted areas – Syntrichia ruralis, which is the most suitable species for bioindication based on this work. Moss species Ceratodon purpureus accumulated the most Cd, Cu, and Fe, then Brachythecium rutabulum/Sciuro-hypnum curtum, and Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus the least. Statistically significant higher Fe concentrations were in the Syntrichia ruralis, compared to the Sciuro-hypnum curtum and Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus. The Syntrichia ruralis also had significantly higher Cd content compared to the Brachythecium rutabulum/Sciuro-hypnum curtum. The results of the GLM analysis showed that the content of various heavy metals depends on the moss species and the degree of fine particles in the environment, and it didn't depend on whether the moss grows on the soil or a hard substrate such as concrete, stone or asphalt."

It incorporates external data on environmental exposures, including traffic noise levels, air quality, and street-level greenery into the street and paths network produced by the OpenStreetMap project. Written in the Python programming language, the software applies a novel environmental impedance function in the least cost path routing to find exposure-optimised routes. Routes for externally defined origin-destination pairs can be queried via a RESTful API. The API returns alternative routes equipped with rich exposure data. The published version of the software has been applied in population level environmental exposure assessment and in an end-user-oriented web-based route planner application designed for use in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area."
2023,Kuno Kooser (Author); Marta Berholts (Author),Photodissociation of bromine-substituted nitroimidazole radiosensitizers,,,"Heavy elements and some nitroimidazoles both exhibit radiosensitizing properties through different mechanisms. In an effort to see how the overall radiosensitivity might be affected when the two radiosensitizers are combined in the same molecule, we studied the gas-phase photodissociation of two brominated nitroimidazoles and a bromine-free reference sample. Synchrotron radiation was employed to initiate the photodynamics and energy-resolved multiparticle coincidence spectroscopy was used to study the ensuing dissociation. We observed the brominated samples releasing high amounts of potentially radiosensitizing fragments upon dissociation. Since bromination also increases the likelihood of the drug molecule being ionised per a given X-ray dose, we conclude that heavy-element substitution of nitroimidazoles appears to be a viable path towards new, potent radiosensitizer drugs."
2022,Stephan Dudeck (Author),Hybridity in a Western Siberian Bear Ceremony,bear ceremony | extractivism | Khanty | paternalism | perspectivism,,"Hybridity is often discussed in connection with the postcolonial condition. The cultural revival of the Khanty bear ceremony in Western Siberia could be a perfect example. It is on one hand a key representation of local Indigenous ontology and on the other has become a token in cultural heritage preservation by state actors and a cultural commodity for local tourism and media outlets. Indigenous activists struggle against the loss of authenticity with ideas of purism and scholars identifying the amalgamation of Indigenous ritual elements with Christian ideas and inventions of tradition on the other hand. I argue that the perception of original purity of elements that develop into hybrid forms in the colonial and postcolonial context is somewhat misleading. Instead, I propose that we look at hybridity and purity as intertwined dialectical aspects of cultural politics with a multiplicity of voices and perspectives and negotiated relations at several levels."

2023,Edgars Eihmanis (Author),Populist party-producer group alliances and divergent developmentalist politics of minimum wages in Poland and Hungary,,"Minimum wages, right-wing populist parties, producer groups, developmentalism, Hungary, Poland","In the advanced peripheral economies of East-Central Europe, right-wing populist parties have increasingly politicized the dualism between larger, export-competitive foreign-owned enterprises and smaller, inward-oriented and less productive domestically owned firms. By focusing on the two most-similar cases of right-wing populist governments in the region—namely, Hungary and Poland, this paper documents a striking attempt by Poland’s Law and Justice party to use increases in the minimum wage and social security contributions as a developmentalist tool that should force domestically owned firms to achieve greater efficiency and technological upgrading. In sharp contrast, Hungary’s Fidesz party has systematically compensated minimum wage increases with cuts in employer social contributions and has refrained from assigning developmentalist aims to labor cost increases. Both parties have cultivated a cross-class electoral base and have faced electoral trade-offs in emphasizing minimum wage increases. Yet we argue—and show through a comparative historical analysis—that variation in their policy approaches stems from their distinct, electorally motivated, alliances with influential producer groups and the distinct policy quid pro quos they have struck with those groups, namely, organized labor for Law and Justice and organized business for Fidesz."
2023,Veronika Kalmus (Author),Conducting Online Focus Group Interviews With Two Generations: Methodological Experiences and Reflections From the Pandemic Context,qualitative research; methodology; interviews; focus groups,,"In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, many research projects were forced to adapt their design and conduct interviews online. This paper discusses the benefits and challenges of using online focus groups with participants representing different generations and cultural and social backgrounds. Based on the researchers’ experiences and field notes from a three-country comparative project, aiming at analysing the extent to which previous experience of state surveillance impacted attitudes to commercial monitoring and tracking of online behaviour among two generational cohorts, the paper identifies seven aspects where the move from offline to online interviewing interfered with the original research design. The paper suggests that most of these interferences resulted in a need to adjust the methodology to better fit the online setting. We reflect critically upon the issues of technological preconditions and digital skills, recruitment, group size, degrees of previous acquaintance, the role of the interviewer, participants’ household status and media environment, and ethical considerations concerning privacy and data management. Based on these methodological insights, we conclude that future online focus group research would benefit from using smaller groups and adjusted moderation, flexibility in interviewing tools and channels, and new, online-specific ethical considerations when planning, executing, and analysing interviews. The paper advocates the complementarity between inperson and online focus groups as two modalities of data collection and argues for the normalization of hybrid methods."

2024,Denys Teptiuk (Author); Eda-Riin Tuuling (Author),Manner expressions in Finnish and Estonian: their use in quotative constructions and beyond,,,"In this study, we look at manner demonstratives (such as ‘so’ and similative prepositions (such as ‘like’) in complex sentences of two Finnic languages: Finnish and Estonian. We expand previous accounts of these manner expressions (MEs) in quotative constructions and investigate their use with epistemic (‘know’, ‘guess’) and perceptive (‘see’, ‘hear’, ‘feel’) verbs in non-standard written communications. In addition to the results from two Finnic languages, in the discussion of this article, we pay attention to the similarities found in the use of MEs with these verbs in Finno-Ugric languages spoken in Russia. The results show that MEs contribute to the expression of epistemic processes and perception in both languages. Manner demonstratives are used as endophoric markers pointing at demonstrations and descriptions of the event perceived. Co-occurring with the epistemic verb ‘know’, manner demonstratives induce a non-factive construal and cancel the presupposition that the speaker considers the proposition to be true. With inherently subjective verbs like ‘understand’ and in some contexts with perceptive verbs like ‘see, seem’, and ‘feel’, they indicate the subjective interpretation of the event. The reportative function is observed with the auditory perceptive verbs ‘hear’ and ‘be heard’, where the manner demonstratives highlight the reporter’s uncertainty or indicate the verbatim rendering of the report. Furthermore, they can express the speaker’s wishful thinking while co-occurring with a visual perceptive verb ‘see’. In turn, similative markers are used in reportative function as already established quotatives and mark reports as approximately reproduced or typical for the event described. Co-occurring with perceptive verbs, they can express the speaker’s doubt or mark propositions as counterfactual."
2023,Kristi Jõeste (Author),Innovation in Estonian heritage-based knitting,,"innovation, tradition, hand knitting, Embroidery","Innovation is an intentionally introduced significant and positive change to an existent practice. In crafts, innovation is challenging because, by nature, crafts are based on traditions and collective knowledge; they involve practising something the way it has always been practiced. If anything changes, it is copied rapidly by other craftspeople. In this article, I explain innovation in traditional glove-knitting through the concept of transformation of the tradition, and I analyse the case using a method called technique-concept-utility-structure-material (TCUSM), which was introduced by Adhi Nugraha in 2010. According to this method, one must know the tradition thoroughly in order to make conscious and justifiable changes to it. One must compare and explain what is traditional and what is new in one’s products. I combine this method with an artistic autoethnographic approach. Within my personal practice, the most significant change to the original involves combining and borrowing aesthetic elements from other traditional textiles or developing my own combinations of patterns and colours. First, I give a short over­view of the history of embroidered gloves in Estonia, then demonstrate, with the help of explanations and photographs, contemporary gloves, made by me."

In this paper, we review the literature on using machine learning to cope with challenges associated with spatial autocorrelation. Our focus was on studies in which researchers predicted environmental variables using a supervised machine learning regression algorithm that accounted for spatial autocorrelation in any part of the modeling pipeline from data exploration to model validation. Methods included explicit spatial covariates, data splitting for training–testing, model calculations, and independent exploratory analysis. Authors accounted for spatial autocorrelation most often in the independent exploratory analysis which had no impact on the predicted values.

We concluded that there seems to be no overall systematic approach on how to account for spatial autocorrelation in machine learning models. In the selected studies, the most appropriate spatial method depended on the specific characteristics of the study. Using explicit spatial covariates and data splitting for training-testing provided more insights into a method's applicability. We summarize these insights and provide considerations for selecting the most appropriate method."

This article reveals that one of the comparative advantages of small LGs is agricultural land. System failures are hindering the necessary innovativeness of farms and interventions at the local level. This article focuses on land consolidation as one possible intervention. Panel data consisting of 392 Estonian farms covering the years 2014 to 2019 were used to study the relationship between the farm structure measured by the area-weighted mean size of the parcels and the probability of implementing innovation activity. The result of the logit model with fixed effects shows that the structure of the farm and the probability to invest in buildings, machinery, equipment, and inventory are positively related. Small LGs can use this intervention for various aims and must consider environmental goals, country-specific planning systems, legislation, and farm owners’ willingness to participate in land consolidation."
2023,Juho Kaarlo Sakari Lindholm (Author),Cybernetic Epistemology,categories | Charles S. Peirce | cybernetics | Eino Kaila | epistemology | experience | invariance | John Dewey | meaning | pragmatism,,"Mainstream analytic epistemology conceives knowledge as
representation: as true justified (un-Gettiered) belief. Such representation
is conceived as independent of practice, its justification to consist in
experience, and experience as mere observation. Such notion of experience
is too narrow to take the epistemic value of experimentation into account.
But science is emphatically experimental. On the other hand, John Dewey
defined experience as organism–environment interaction. Such interaction
is bidirectional and hence experimental by nature. It involves feedback.
Cybernetics studies feedback systems. Hence, cybernetic epistemology is
a consequence of Dewey’s definition. Cybernetic epistemology maintains
that knowledge is practice, that is, an (approximately and relatively)
invariant pattern of potential organism–environment interaction, rather
than something independent of practice. In this article, I will make a case
for cybernetic epistemology. It seems to dispense with the representational
notion of knowledge and to provide an original justification for process
ontology."

Method: An experiment was conducted in Estonia, with two groups: those who spoke Estonian as their first language and those who spoke Russian as their first language and Estonian as their second. Both groups listened to Estonian-language radio advertisements presented by various spokespeople, half of which were performed in a calm style (low arousal) and half in an energetic style (high arousal). They then rated the likability of each performance.

Results: The results showed that both groups preferred the calm style but there were significant differences in the scores: the first group gave the calm style significantly higher scores than the second group, while the latter scored the energetic style more highly.

Conclusion: Knowing the advertising style preferences in a society where people have different first languages may allow for better targeting of advertising."
2022,Andu Rämmer (Author); Rein Murakas (Author); Terje Toomistu (Author),Noorte väärtused peegelduvad ka nende rändekäitumises,,"noored, välisränne, väärtused, uuringud","Opportunities for people of Estonia to move internationally for work or study purposes have increased significantly over the past few decades, affecting the migration behaviour of the younger generation in particular. It is important to pay attention to east-west migration in the context of the brain drain and youth drain, as mass emigration of educated people has negative economic consequences for the countries of origin. This article focuses on the relationship between the value orientations and migration behaviour of Estonian young people aged 20–35 who have long-term experience of living and/or studying abroad.
Values refer to desirable goals or ways of achieving them, they transcend situations, shape behaviour in different situations and are ordered according to importance. Interrelated values are known as value orientations, which can be categorized as extrinsic, intrinsic and social values. A person’s values develop through socialisation, based on the experiences acquired at a young age, and remain relatively stable throughout their lives. The values of young people are studied more often, because according to the socialisation hypothesis the dominant values in society change slowly, primarily through generational replacement.
In a survey (N=2022) conducted in the framework of the interdisciplinary study “Young Estonians Abroad” at the Institute of Cultural Research of the University of Tartu, young adults with longer experience of living abroad rated the importance of various work values in their lives. While after the transition to a market economy young Estonians attached the highest importance to the possibility of earning a good salary, and having a secure job and career opportunities were also considered more important than before, the importance of intrinsic work values has increased since then.
The results of our survey research show that the respondents who have returned to Estonia as well as the respondents who have stayed abroad both rated intrinsic and extrinsic values higher than social work values. A closer analysis of extrinsic values reveals their connection with dissatisfaction with the living and working environment in Estonia. Attaching importance to intrinsic values is associated with various development opportunities. The importance of social values is linked to social interaction and sociability.
At the same time, the results also point to a significant divergence in value orientations between those who have returned or intend to return and those who have stayed abroad and do not intend to return. Those who consider extrinsic work values important tend to prefer to stay abroad, while those who appreciate intrinsic and social work values tend to prefer to return."
2024,María José Guzmán Monsalve (Author),Contemplating the Fate of Modified Gravity,,,"Possible models of modified gravity are being extensively studied now, with most phenomenological motivations coming from puzzles and tensions in cosmology due to a natural desire to better fit the known and newly coming data. At the same time, available experimental evidence is limited for testing gravity as a force beyond the regimes in which the theory of general relativity has proven to be successful. This situation leads researchers to look for “the simplest modification” to general relativity in a certain class of models, which is enough to solve one or more problems. As a result, we are lost amid a variety of theories with no deeper guiding principle. We give a general review of existing approaches and discuss the current state of the art."

Smart cities","Sharing Internet of Things (IoT) data across different sectors, such as in smart cities, becomes complex due to heterogeneity. This poses challenges related to a lack of interoperability, data quality issues and lack of context information, and a lack of data veracity (or accuracy). In addition, there are privacy concerns as IoT data may contain personally identifiable information. To address the above challenges, this paper presents a novel semantic technology-based framework that enables data sharing in a GDPR-compliant manner while ensuring that the data shared is interoperable, contains required context information, is of acceptable quality, and is accurate and trustworthy. The proposed framework also accounts for the edge/fog, an upcoming computing paradigm for the IoT to support real-time decisions. We evaluate the performance of the proposed framework with two different edge and fog–edge scenarios using resource-constrained IoT devices, such as the Raspberry Pi. In addition, we also evaluate shared data quality, interoperability and veracity. Our key finding is that the proposed framework can be employed on IoT devices with limited resources due to its low CPU and memory utilization for analytics operations and data transformation and migration operations. The low overhead of the framework supports real-time decision making. In addition, the 100% accuracy of our evaluation of the data quality and veracity based on 180 different observations demonstrates that the proposed framework can guarantee both data quality and veracity."

in Sodankylä, Finland. Six groups from five countries (Estonia, Finland, Greenland, Iceland, and
Sweden) participated, using 12 different snow samplers, including 9 bulk tube samplers and 3 density
cutters. The cross-sectional area of the SWE samplers varied from 11 to 100 cm2, while tube length
varied from 30 cm to 100 cm. The cross-sectional area of the density profile cutters varied from
100 cm2 to 200 cm2 and the vertical sampling step varied from 5 cm to 10 cm. The samples were
taken from snow pits in 55–65-centimeter-deep snow cover in a flat area with sparse pine trees, with
the pits at a maximum distance of 10 m from each other. Each tube sampling series consisted of
3–10 vertical columns to ensure statistical validation. The snowpack was relatively soft, with two
moderately hard crust layers. The density recorded in the tube sample measurements varied from
218 to 265 kgm􀀀3. The measurement results of SWE, however, varied depending on the sampling
equipment used, ranging from 148 to 180 kgm􀀀2, with two outliers of 77 and 106 kgm-2, both with

Automata-based techniques
Multi-process specifications
Hybrid processes","So far, approaches for business process modeling, enactment and monitoring have mainly been based on process specifications consisting of a single process model. This setting aptly captures monolithic scenarios from domains in which all possible behaviors can be folded into a single model. However, the same strategy cannot be applied to domains where multiple interacting (procedural) processes simultaneously work over the same objects, in the presence of additional (declarative) constraints relating activities from the same or different processes. A relevant example for this setting is that of healthcare, where co-morbid patients may be subject to multiple clinical pathways at once, in the presence of additional, general constraints capturing basic medical knowledge. To fill this gap, we have previously presented the M3 Framework and an accompanying monitoring technique, which allows for a hybrid representation of a process using both procedural and declarative models, and supports the modular creation of multi-process specifications where domain experts can focus on specific procedures and domain constraints without being forced to merge them into one single specification. In this paper, we make significant extensions to this framework, allowing us to go from simple toy examples towards addressing practical real-life scenarios. We achieve this by introducing a richer form of integration between the interacting process components, in particular supporting asynchronous and synchronous activities that may operate over local and global (shared) data variables. This is framed by a discussion of the business meaning of these concepts, the introduction of the corresponding modeling patterns, and the application of our approach to real-life business processes, the latter being the driving-force behind this paper."
2024,Halliki Harro-Loit (Author),News Media Monitoring Capabilities in 14 European Countries: Problems and Best Practices,,,"Social acceleration has been a catalyst for rapid changes concerning the mediascapes of European societies. Democratic societies need deliberation, but what kinds of journalism and communication cultures are supported by different stakeholders and structural possibilities? The aim of this article is to conceptualise and analyse the risks and opportunities concerning the monitoring capabilities in key domains of the media field. This includes the performance and normative regulation of news media (journalism) as well as media usage patterns and competencies of different actors, all of which influence the quality of deliberative communication across cultures. The monitoring potential is related to various stakeholders who gather data and information on media and media usage, transform the information into knowledge, and use this knowledge to create evidence-based media policy. What interests and values are served by which stakeholders and how does this actual monitoring serve the media policy in different European countries? What is the role and resources of media researchers? These questions are answered with the help of an extensive literature review and a synoptic analysis of the monitoring capabilities of 14 European countries, based on original case studies. The article will, thus, broaden the conceptual understanding of risks and opportunities for deliberative communication in democratic societies—and at the same time offer an initial inventory of typical problems and best practices for monitoring deliberative communication across Europe."

Some of these fungi are strict specialists and only associate with one Nostoc phylogroup throughout their range, while others are generalists and associate with many different Nostoc phylogroups. We sampled 20 Peltigera taxa, mostly representing the Peltigera section Peltigera, from grassland and forest habitats across Europe. Mycobionts’ identities were confirmed using fungal ITS sequences. The Nostoc cyanobionts were identified and grouped based on single nucleotide differences in the trnL region and on the phylogenetic analysis of the rbcLX region. Our data confirmed that some Peltigera species clearly prefer open habitats, while others are largely confined to shady forest habitats. The two habitat preferences are consistently paired with association with different Nostoc groups. As a specific example, two ecologically versatile species, Peltigera canina and P. didactyla, both growing in open and shady habitats, consistently associated with different groups of Nostoc when growing in different habitats. As associations between specific mycobionts and cyanobionts are influenced by habitat conditions, the diversity of both taxon groups should be considered in the context of habitat management and conservation planning."

In four concise chapters, the group of experts, consisting of Indigenous and non-Indigenous researchers and Indigenous rights holders, 1) guide the readership through the legal and political dimensions as well as that of research innovation and paradigmatic shifts in Arctic research; 2) it offers concrete methodological considerations in carrying out projects; 3) it elaborates on the participation of Indigenous rights holders in the EU research funding structures from a practice perspective. 4) it outlines the benefits of Indigenous-led Arctic research and of funding co-creative projects. This Roadmap can support the mainstreaming of co-creative and collaborative principles and equal partnership by Indigenous and non-Indigenous actors in 1) large-scale research projects, 2) calls for projects, 3) proposal design and project evaluation, and 4) in the implementation of the European Polar Research Program.
At the international level, the rights of Indigenous Peoples have been receiving increasing legal recognition. Similarly, EU calls-for-proposals ask nowadays increasingly for a ‘co-design approach’ in research (e.g., in the past Horizon 2020, and the current Horizon Europe funding schemes). Arctic researchers are increasingly adopting decolonial research approaches. Yet implementing decolonial research practices as new standards  and taking initiative that supports Indigenous sovereignty in the Arctic is often still lacking. Therefore, theoretical and methodological expertise about co-creation of knowledge, as offered in this Roadmap, can help to foster capacity among researchers in all disciplines (natural and social sciences, the humanities) and among the relevant funding bodies such as the EU Commission and the large variety of international and national funding organisations."

Twelve male road cyclists aged 18–30 years (mean training experience 9.9 ± 2.5 years) participated. Pelvic anthropometric data and body composition were measured with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Participants performed 30 min cycling at 50% peak power output at constant intensity on a cyclus-2 ergometer. Muscle fatigue during cycling was assessed by surface electromyogram spectral mean power frequency (MPF) for the back, gluteal, and thigh muscles. The pressure mapping system was used to assess sitting symmetry before and after the cycling exercise. At the end of cycling, MPF was decreased (p < 0.05) in the dominant side’s erector spinae muscle and the contralateral gluteal muscle. After the exercise, a significant (p < 0.05) asymmetry in seat pressure was observed under the ischial tuberosity based on the peak pressure right to left ratio, whereas peak pressure decreased under the left ischial tuberosity. After the exercise, the relationship (p < 0.05) between pelvis width and pressure under the ischial tuberosity occurred on the dominant side of the body. In conclusion, an asymmetry was revealed after the constant-load cycling exercise by peak pressure ratio right to left side. Further studies should address the role of seat pressure asymmetries before and after cycling exercises at different intensities and durations.

2024,Arne Merilai (Author),Artur Alliksaare alliteratiivsed arhetüübid,,"poetics, free verse, runic verse, primal poetry, baroque poetry, poetry revival","The article explores the free-verse poetics of Artur Alliksaar (1923–1966), Estonia’s
foremost poet of language. Alliksaar faced poverty and repression under the
Soviet regime, making it challenging to publish his work. A small selection of his
poems were published as a book only posthumously. Nonetheless, Alliksaar’s influence
on the poetry revival of the 1960s and the emerging generation of poets was
profound. Estonian poetry and the language itself have been forever altered by his
volcanic inspiration.
In the late 1950s, Estonia witnessed a fierce debate over free verse: while the official
stance favoured conservative metrical forms, the younger generation championed
formal and substantive freedom. Alliksaar initially wrote in elegant metrical
forms like sonnets and rhymed quatrains, but by 1960, he too embraced free verse.
The article suggests that he drew inspiration from Walt Whitman’s prose-like long
lines, which he meticulously instrumented and enriched with figurative devices,
resulting in an unprecedented, baroque orchestration.
Alliksaar held deep reverence for the poetics of Estonian runic verse and consistently
employed alliteration and open parallelism in his compelling associative
compositions. His impressive arsenal includes all manners of figurative devices

used hyperbolically and comically. Unprecedented in Estonian poetry is the flood of
linguistic wizardry: diverse repetitions, extended metaphors and metalepses, catachrestic
contrasts and systematic antitheses, paradoxical puns, echoes and chiasms,
refined vocabulary and ad hoc neologisms, rhetorical syntax, and graphic articulation.
It could be argued that Alliksaar’s volcanic alliterative innovation finds its
archetype in the free-verse-like primal structure of proto-accentual chants and lamentations
that preceded quantitative runic verse."

It poses the following questions: 1. How do the representatives of community houses perceive their roles and challenges? 2. How does organizational agency and cultural policy (at national and subnational level) contribute to cultural sustainability in the context of such disruptions? To answer the first question, in 2022 we conducted empirical research among representatives of Estonian community houses. The second question provides historical, political and cultural context to address the first. Estonian community houses, numbering 376 in operation today, are a unique network to study. In the nineteenth century, these cultural hubs became the basis for the system of nonformal life-long education, arts, and culture, and later regulated and developed within the subnational politics of culture and education in the Estonian nation-state, in the Soviet Union and in today's Estonia (1991's Estonia ( -2023) ) as part of the European Union. The Covid-19 pandemic added a new set of disruptions. In this light, the continuity of the functioning of community houses, alongside their ability to adapt, becomes particularly important for both local communities and sustainable cultural development."

Over the last 30 years, the country underwent a bold transformation from a planned to a market economy, yet the relationship between the theatre and the economic system remains virtually unexplored. Today’s Lithuanian performing arts system embraces two types of producers – governmental institutions and independent companies – that evolved from two contradictory economic doctrines. The analysis of their activities is grounded on statistical data, resources of the companies including funding allocations, and qualitative interviews with creators and artistic heads of production companies. The research suggests the influence of neoliberalism on the Lithuanian performing arts at the institutional and state levels, highlighting a large market share of independent companies tuned to the neoliberal government, a transformation of organisation in governmental theatres, underdevelopment in the distribution market, as well as issues related to public financing."

This comprehensive review examines the current knowledge on reproductive microbiomes across various parts of female reproductive tract, with special consideration of bidirectional interactions between microbiomes and the immune system. Additionally, it explores innate and adaptive immunity, focusing on immunoglobulin (Ig) A and IgM antibodies, their regulation, self-antigen tolerance mechanisms, and their roles in immune homeostasis. This review also highlights ongoing technological innovations in microbiota research, emphasizing the need for standardized detection and analysis methods. For instance, we evaluate the clinical utility of innovative technologies such as Phage ImmunoPrecipitation Sequencing (PhIP-Seq) and Microbial Flow Cytometry coupled to Next-Generation Sequencing (mFLOW-Seq). Despite ongoing advancements, we emphasize the need for further exploration in this field, as a deeper understanding of immunome-microbiome interactions holds promise for innovative diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for reproductive health, like infertility treatment and management of pregnancy."

By deflecting solar wind particles off their original course, it can generate a propulsive effect with nothing more than an electric charge. The high-voltage charge is applied to one or multiple centrifugally deployed hair-thin tethers, around which an electrostatic sheath is created. Electron emitters are required to compensate for the electron current gathered by the tether. The electric sail can also be utilised in low Earth orbit, or LEO, when passing through the ionosphere, where it serves as a plasma brake for deorbiting—several missions have been dedicated to LEO demonstration. In this article, we propose the ESTCube-LuNa mission concept and the preliminary cubesat design to be launched into the Moon’s orbit, where the solar wind is uninterrupted, except for the lunar wake and when the Moon is in the Earth’s magnetosphere. This article introduces E-sail demonstration experiments and the preliminary payload design, along with E-sail thrust validation and environment characterisation methods, a cis-lunar cubesat platform solution and an early concept of operations. The proposed lunar nanospacecraft concept is designed without a deep space network, typically used for lunar and deep space operations. Instead, radio telescopes are being repurposed for communications and radio frequency ranging, and celestial optical navigation is developed for on-board orbit determination."
2022,Silver Loit (Author),Välisministeeriumi protokolliteenistus (1918-1940): kujunemine ja kujundajad,foreign policy; diplomacy; protocol; interwar Estonia,,"The emergence of diplomatic protocol service within the structure of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) of Estonia (1918–40) is a subject that has hitherto not been researched. This is illustrated by the fact that even the complete list of chiefs of protocol (chef du protocole) of the MFA of Estonia has been missing until now. The strengthening of Estonia’s statehood by its international recognition, the accreditation of foreign envoys, and the first state visits brought about the need for a thorough understanding of all nuances of diplomatic protocol and ceremonial. Nevertheless, the office of a separate chief of protocol was created in the structure of the MFA of Estonia only according to the new Foreign Service Act, decreed by the Head of State Konstantin Päts on 13 March 1936; i.e. more than 18 years after the declaration of Estonia’s independence. Prior to 1936, the functions of protocol officers were usually fulfilled by the head of the MFA’s administrative or political department. This article focuses on three core issues: 1) who were the chiefs of protocol? 2) their functions and how diplomatic protocol was regulated in the MFA; 3) the reason why a separate office of the chief of protocol was not created earlier than 1936. The key source for this research is the MFA collection in the Estonian National Archives (RA, ERA.957).

There are no clear sources regarding the functions of the chief of protocol before 1922. The field was most probably shaped and shared by several officials, including the head of the political department Hermann Karl Hellat (1872–1953) and William Tomingas (1895–1972), the junior private secretary of Foreign Minister Jaan Tõnisson (1868–1941?). Everything connected to international practices was probably influenced by the most experienced diplomats of the young state, namely the members of Estonia’s foreign delegation, which had already been created in 1917. Another major influence was Foreign Minister Jaan Poska (1866–1920), who as a former mayor of Tallinn, the former governor of the autonomous Governorate of Estonia, and the head of Estonia’s delegation at the peace talks with Soviet Russia, had extensive experience in protocol-related matters.

Hans Johannes (Johan) Ernst Markus (1884–1969) can be deemed the first chief of protocol to be mentioned in the hitherto known sources of the MFA. According to an MFA report to the Estonian government from July of 1922, Markus was the head of the MFA’s Western political department and performed the duties of ‘master of ceremonies’ as well. In January of 1923, Markus was appointed head of the MFA’s administrative department. He remained in this office until April of 1927, coordinating the state visits of the President of Latvia Jānis Čakste (February of 1924), the Secretary General of the League of Nations Eric Drummond (February of 1924), and the President of Finland Lauri Kristian Relander (May of 1925), as well as the state visits of Estonia’s Head of State, the presentation of credentials, and day-to-day work regarding diplomatic privileges and immunities. Since the chief of protocol was responsible for organising ceremonies connected to the Head of State (Riigivanem), Markus could be considered not only as a coordinator of the MFA’s protocol matters, but as the chief of state protocol. Markus certainly did not work alone. He could rely on the administrative department and basically the whole MFA in fulfilling his functions, while also counting on the support of the aide-de-camp to the Head of State. Nevertheless, it was Markus who laid the ’cornerstone’ for the best practices that could be systematised and used by his successors.

In April of 1927, the functions of the chief of protocol were taken over by Johan Leppik (1894–1965), the former Envoy to Poland and Romania, and Chargé d’Affaires in Czechoslovakia. In August of 1927, Leppik was appointed head of the MFA’s political department. According to the MFA’s working arrangement, Leppik retained the functions of chef du protocole in his new office starting from January of 1928. Since the grand, first-ever state visit of a monarch to Estonia, by King Gustaf V of Sweden in June of 1929, and the visit of the President of Poland Ignacy Mościcki in August of 1930 (which were preceded by the state visits of Estonia’s Head of State to those countries) required extensive preparations, Leppik could rely on the work of his subordinate, the head of the political bureau and deputy chief of protocol Elmar-Johann Kirotar (1899–1985). In June of 1931, Leppik was succeeded by the director of the bureau of law Artur Haman (Tuldava) (1897–1942) in his office as chief of protocol. Haman (Tuldava) put great effort into systematising existing practices related to protocol (incl. Presentation of credentials, and receptions) into a comprehensive compendium, which has been preserved to this day. The efficient work of Kirotar and Tuldava was probably noted by Estonia’s leadership, since once the separaate office of the chief of protocol had been created within the structure of the MFA, the position was filled first by Kirotar (1936–9) and then by Tuldava (1939–40). The quest for stability was most probably connected to the strong presidential power that shaped Estonia’s political life in the latter half of the 1930s. The personal influence of the head of state became more important in filling high-ranking positions in the state structure. According to the Foreign Service Act adopted by Parliament (Riigikogu) on 30 May 1930, departmental directors were appointed by the Foreign Minister. The Foreign Service Act decreed by the Head of State on 13 March 1936 changed this procedure. According to the latter, departmental directors (incl. the chief of protocol) were appointed and dismissed by the Head of State (upon taking into consideration proposals from the Foreign Minister).

There is no clear answer to the question of why there was no separate office of the chief of protocol in the 1920s, since these functions needed to be fulfilled anyway. This was most probably connected to budgetary restrictions i.e. the need to avoid all kinds of ’unnecessary’ expenses.

In the 1930s, the director of the administrative department Jaan Mölder (1880–1942, in office 1935–6) and the head of the consular bureau August Koern (1900–89, in office 1936) also briefly fulfilled the functions of the chief of protocol. The latter was especially involved in systematising the rules and regulations of diplomatic practices. Like his predecessors and successors, he sent numerous inquiries to Estonia’s representations abroad to collect information on matters connected to privileges and immunities, decorations, preseance, organisation of state funerals, etc.

According to sources at the Estonian National Archives, Estonia’s MFA collected information on international diplomatic practice everywhere that it was represented by its missions abroad. Already during the first years of Estonia’s independence, the MFA possessed the popular Guide to Diplomatic Practice by Sir Ernest Mason Satow (first issued in 1917) and several protocol-related compendiums from Finland, the United States of America, Great Britain, etc. It can be concluded that without a rich heritage of diplomatic practice of its own, Estonia was quickly able to successfully adapt to the international environment in matters of diplomatic protocol."

Seep carbonates were sampled with remotely operated vehicles (ROV) from the seafloor at three active hydrocarbon seeps (water depth 156–383 m), located in the north-west (Storfjordrenna), north-central (Storbanken High), and south-west (Loppa High) Barents Sea. Overall, the U–Th dates range from 13.5 to 1.2 thousand years (ka) before present, indicating episodic seep carbonate formation since the late Pleistocene throughout the Holocene. The new U–Th dates indicate protracted post-glacial gas seepage, congruent with previously published seep carbonate ages from the south-west Barents Sea. Gas hydrate dissociation and associated seep carbonate formation occurred at Storfjordrenna between ≈6 and 1.2 ka, and around 13.5 and 6 ka at Storbanken. Early and late Holocene seep carbonate ages from Loppa High support post-glacial seismic activity as potential seepage trigger mechanism."

reported in the literature. We present a dynamical scenario for the evolving disc density from a diffuse to a dense phase. Also,
we determine that the inclination of the disc is about 40◦ which means it is 20◦ tilted from the orbit of the secondary star. Our
results indicate that the mass loss rate for MT91-213 is ∼ 10−7 to 10−6 𝑀⊙ /yr which is in agreement with the suggested values

existence in Mongolian lands, it has undergone many changes. During the socialist period, it
became invisible in the religious landscape, in the 1990s it reappeared and in the 21st century it
thrives on a wave of renewed popularity. This paper discusses the Tibetan history of the ritual,
its philosophical background and its textual, ritual and social forms in contemporary Mongolia,
with a particular focus on its distinctive features, meanings and functions, which have been
influenced and enriched by numerous traditions. Furthermore, the strategies used by different stakeholders in the struggle for the interpretative sovereignty of this ritual are examined, as well
as the role that narrative culture, ritual and discursive practices play in this process. In order to
investigate these complex issues, we explore the different perspectives of ritual actors (both the
various ritual specialists and lay devotees) involved in contemporary ritual traditions"

Ingrian language. The material for the research comes from a collection of spontaneous
speech samples recorded in the 21st century. Most examples are being published for
the first time. The article presents mainly a qualitative analysis and aims to provide an
overview of the basic functions of the Ingrian demonstrative pronouns tämä and še. It is
shown that in contemporary Ingrian the demonstratives are used as deictic and anaphoric
devices, and also as discourse markers. Individual speakers demonstrate differences in
the use of these pronouns due to the contact influence from neighbouring languages."

Ecological Engagements and Multispecies Relationships
",,"Belief, Multi-species, Human-animal transformations, Khasi, Ethnography","This article engages with Water as a core medium in folklore among Khasi, an indigenous community in Northeast India. In the context of the corpus of narratives that engage, interact with, involve, and folklorise water – what will henceforth be called, the folklore of water – I look at human-animal transformation traditions. Leaning heavily on empirical material derived from primary fieldwork, this article looks at the folklore of water as is home to sanghkini or ‘hybrid’ persons who transform into weresnakes during the monsoon season. Aside from fulfilling its mundane utilitarian purposes water among Khasi is more: water is expressive of the Khasi knowledge of the world around. As will be discussed, water is a form of indigenous knowledge. If we look at water as a tradition-resource, it will allow disparate expressions of Khasi religious expression – gender switching in shapeshifter form; astral travel in sangkhini-dreaming; examples of multispecies relationalities – to be viewed together as articulations of water as mediator, enabling new layers of understanding.

2024,Tiiu Jaago (Author),Success Story or Traumatic Experience? An Attempt to Integrate Trauma Theory with Oral History Research for the Interpretation of First-Person Stories,,"conflicting identities, life story, oral history, Stalinist era, trauma ","This article focuses on the following issues: (1) how a narrator describes life under political repression in a retrospective first-person story; (2) the extent to which such a story can be analysed from the perspective of trauma theory; (3) what the use of trauma theory in combination with the methods of folk narrative and oral history research can offer for a more diverse interpretation of such a story. The story selected for observation was written in 2001, focusing on events in Soviet Estonia (1940–1941, 1944–1991). At the time of telling this story, the Soviet era was publicly interpreted as a period of interruption of Estonian cultural and political continuity. Social scientists observed the Soviet period from the perspective of cultural trauma. In this way, the narrator presented complex past events in a framework that points to the restoration of historical justice. Although this story represents a positive attitude towards historical and cultural developments in Estonia, the analysis of this story indicates that traces of trauma can be found at the levels of the story that reflect the formation of the narrator’s identity."
2023,Leena Käosaar (Author),"""I am Nothing more than a Word in Human Form."" Viivi Luik's Poetics of Identity.",,"Life writing, Estonian literature, Viivi Luik, Adriana Cavarero, relationality, narratable self.","This article offers a discussion of the work of Viivi Luik, one of the most well-known and well-loved contemporary authors and public intellectuals in Estonia, with a focus on her two autobiographical novels, the iconic Seitsmes rahukevad [The Seventh Spring of Peace] (1985) and Varjuteater [The Shadow Theater] (2010). Although recognizably self-representational, Luik’s work is generically ambivalent, particularly The Shadow Theater, where the desire to comprehend human existence emerges through the poetics of encounter and reciprocity of address, forming parallels with Adrina Cavarero’s philosophical paradigm of the narratable self. Identifying points of connection between Cavarero's relational paradigm of selfhood and modes of self-narration that characterize Luik’s literary oeuvre, the article focuses on Luik’s poetics of identity that shapes and ultimately comes to prevail over the politics of identity, resulting in processes of construction of subjectivity that resist the expectations of gendered, national and (Eastern) European categories of identity."
2024,Wolfgang Wagner (Author),"Natural origins of social essentialism: Ethnic groups, identities, and cultural transmission",,,"This paper argues that the term ‘social essence’ is overused in psychological research and includes instances that are not covered by the basic definition of an essentialist cognition with living beings. Imagining an essence of living beings is conceptualized as a meta- cognition that wraps up an exemplars’ characteristics as a marker and assigns it a kind or species. This paper develops a framework of how social essentialism can be con- ceptualised to originate in natural contexts. Ethnic groups maintain a group identity that is defined by a set of diacritical markers and secured by a rule of endogamy, which functionally replicates the procreative pattern in animal species. This ‘functional ho- mological’ relationship construes a group identity in the image of animal kinds. Thus construed, an ethnic identity appears as a natural given that safeguards the group’s cohesion and stability across generations. Hence, group-related essentialism primarily serves identity formation and provides a cognitive mechanism to distinguish the ingroup from outgroups. The intuition of an essentialised identity is perpetuated across gener- ations by bio-social processes of enculturation. Such processes can explain an historically stable group essentialism, as well as group-biased judgements in former and contem- porary societies without the need for innate sources of psychological essentialism."

Based on a qualitative interview study of two generations of media users in Estonia, Portugal, and Sweden we present and analyse underlying patterns in participants’ media attitudes and related practices. We show that belonging to a media generation does not always produce a homogeneous mindset or a uniform attitude towards media technologies. These mindsets, being ideal-typical constructs, are not bound to individuals: the same person can display features of the analogue and the datafied mindset in relation to different parts of the datafied world. One mindset does not replace the other, but rather adds another layer to the social action of the individuals. The mindsets are multi-dimensional and moulded by contrasting understandings indicating that the tenacious structures of the analogue world linger on in the datafied social space."
2024,Wolfgang Wagner (Author),Can essences mix? An essentialist theory of genetic hybrids in the human and animal domain,,,"This paper reviews research on biological essentialist beliefs and what these entail for perceiving genetic hybrids. It is suggested that hybrid perception results from the characteristics of essentialist reasoning, according to which living beings are endowed with a specific identity as a member of a natural kind. The most important elements of attributing an essence onto an individual are its perceived causal power to determine group membership, being immutable, discrete with regard to an individual's membership in exactly one category, making members of a category appear homogeneous, and ensuring intergenerational stability. Mixing two essences as in genetic engineering strips the hybrid of an unambiguous identity in perception, and results in its devaluation. Such devaluation seems to occur on a non-conscious level and across cultures. The basic claims not only hold for animal beings but also apply to the human domain and to inter-ethnic procreation, primarily for respondents with conservative worldviews."
2024,Ardi Tampuu (Author),The Effects of Speed and Delays on Test-Time Performance of End-to-End Self-Driving,,,"This study investigates the effects of speed variations and computational delays on the performance of end-to-end autonomous driving systems (ADS). Utilizing 1:10 scale mini-cars with limited computational resources, we demonstrate that different driving speeds significantly alter the task of the driving model, challenging the generalization capabilities of systems trained at a singular speed profile. Our findings reveal that models trained to drive at high speeds struggle with slower speeds and vice versa. Consequently, testing an ADS at an inappropriate speed can lead to misjudgments about its competence. Additionally, we explore the impact of computational delays, common in real-world deployments, on driving performance. We present a novel approach to counteract the effects of delays by adjusting the target labels in the training data, demonstrating improved resilience in models to handle computational delays effectively. This method, crucially, addresses the effects of delays rather than their causes and complements traditional delay minimization strategies. These insights are valuable for developing robust autonomous driving systems capable of adapting to varying speeds and delays in real-world scenarios."
2023,Anzori Shalvovich Georgadze (Author),Optimization of the WLS design for positron emission mammography and Total-Body J-PET systems,,"WLS, J-PET, total-body PET, medical imaging, J-PEM","Total body positron emission tomography (PET) instruments are medical imaging devices that detect and visualize metabolic activity in the entire body. The PET scanner has a ring-shaped detector that surrounds the patient, which detects the gamma rays emitted by the tracer as it decays. Usually, these detectors are made up of scintillation crystals coupled to photodetectors that convert the light produced by the scintillation crystal into electrical signals. The Jagiellonian Positron Emission Mammograph (J-PEM) is the first J-PET prototype module based on a novel idea with a plastic scintillator and wavelength shifter (WLS). At the same time, it is a prototype module for the total-body J-PET system. 
J-PEM can be an effective system for the detection and diagnosis of breast cancer in its early stage by improving sensitivity. This can be achieved using superior timing properties of plastic scintillators and combined with the WLS sheets readout. In this paper, we present an application of the Geant4 program for simulating optical photon transport in the J-PEM module. We aim to study the light transport within scintillator bars and WLS sheets to optimize gamma-ray hit position resolution. We simulated a pencil beam of 511 keV photons impinging the scintillator bar at different locations. For each condition, we calculated the value of the pulse height centroid and the spread of the photon distribution. Some free parameters of the simulation, like the reflectivity and the effective attenuation length in the sheet, were determined from a comparison to experimental data. Finally, we estimate the influence of the application of WLS layer in the total-body J-PET on the scatter fraction.
To optimize the performance of the J-PEM module, we compared geometry with the number of WLS strips 50 and 83. It was found, that spatial resolution was 2.7 mm and 3.5 mm FWHM for 50 and 83 WLS strips respectively. Despite the better granularity, the 83-strip WLS geometry exhibits poorer resolution due to fewer photons being transmitted to the strip, resulting in large fluctuations of signal.

Such ash treatment promotes the revegetation of abandoned extracted peatlands. The aim of this study is to analyze the effect of wood ash (WA15 = 15 t ha−1 and WA10 = 10 t ha−1),oil shale ash (OSA8 = 8 t ha−1), and a mixture of wood ash and oil shale ash (WA10 + OSA8) on the revegetation (vascular plants and bryophytes) of the Puhatu abandoned extracted peatland in NE Estonia. The following results were obtained: (1) The MRPP tests indicate that there are compositional
differences between the treatments. (2) Altogether, 23 vascular plant and 3 bryophyte species were recorded in the treatment areas. (3) Nine years after these ash treatments, the highest mean vascular plant species richness was recorded for WA15 (3.8 ± 0.3) and the lowest for OSA8 (2.0 ± 0.3). (4) A greater number of vascular plant species was observed in the WA15 area. (5) Mixed ash and wood ash had a significant effect on the amount of biomass in vascular plants. Treating with either wood ash or
a mixture of ash ensured the rapid formation of vascular plants and bryophyte layers, contributing to the restoration of the abandoned peatland ecosystem."

Comparing computational measurements with human perception,,"Urban greenery, Human perception, image segmentation, green view index, point cloud methods, NDVI","Urban greenery has been shown to impact the quality of life in our urbanizing societies. While greenery is traditionally mapped top-down, alternative computational approaches have emerged for mapping greenery from the street level to mimic human sight. Despite the variety of these novel mapping approaches, it has remained unclear how well they reflect human perception in reality. We compared a range of both novel and traditional mapping methods with the self-reported perception of urban greenery at randomly selected study sites across Helsinki, the capital of Finland. The mapping methods included both image segmentation and point cloud-based methods to capture human perspective as well as traditional approaches taking the top-down perspective, i.e., land cover and remote sensing-based mapping methods. The results suggest that all the methods tested are strongly associated with the human perception of greenery at the street-level. However, mapped greenery values were consistently lower than the perceived values. Our results support the use of semantic image segmentation methods over color segmentation methods for greenery extraction to be closer to human perception. Point cloud-based approaches and top-down methods can be used as alternatives to image segmentation in case data coverage for the latter is limited. The results highlight a further research need for a comprehensive evaluation on how human perspective should be mimicked in different temporal and spatial conditions."

A detailed description of the physical mechanisms involved in vacuum arcing is yet to be achieved, despite extensive research. In this work, we further develop the modelling of the physical processes involved in the initiation of vacuum arcing, starting from field emission and leading to plasma onset. Our model concurrently combines particle-in-cell with Monte Carlo collisions (PIC-MCC) simulations of plasma processes with finite element-based calculations of electron emission and the associated thermal effects. Including the processes of evaporation, impact ionization and direct field ionization allowed us to observe the dynamics of plasma buildup from an initially cold cathode surface. We simulated a static nanotip at various local fields to study the thresholds for thermal runaway and plasma initiation, identifying the significance of various interactions. We found that direct field ionization of neutrals has a significant effect at high fields on the order of 10 GV/m. Furthermore, we find that cathode surface interactions such as evaporation, sputtering and bombardment heating play a major role in the initiation of vacuum arcs. Consequently, the inclusion of these interactions in vacuum arc simulations is imperative."

Accordingly, analyzing the causes of waiting times in activity transitions can help analysts identify opportunities for reducing the cycle time of a process. This paper proposes a process mining approach to decompose observed waiting times in each activity transition into multiple direct causes and to analyze the impact of each identified cause on the process cycle time efficiency. The approach is implemented as a software tool called Kronos that process analysts can use to upload event logs and obtain analysis results of waiting time causes. The proposed approach was empirically evaluated using synthetic event logs to verify its ability to discover different direct causes of waiting times. The applicability of the approach is demonstrated in a real-life process. Interviews with process mining experts confirm that Kronos is useful and easy to use for identifying improvement opportunities

","Water, alcohols, diols, and glycerol are low-cost blowing agents that can be used to create the desired silicone foam structures. Although their combined use can be beneficial, it remains unclear how it affects the physical properties of the resulting materials. We conducted a comparative study of these hydroxyl-bearing blowing agents in fumed silica- and mica-filled polymer composite systems for simultaneous blowing and crosslinking to obtain a low-density, uniform porosity and superior mechanical properties. The foams were optimized for a uniform open-pore structure with densities ranging from 75 to 150 kg‧m−3. Varying the diol chain length (Cn) from one to seven carbons can alter the foam density and structure, thereby enhancing the foam tensile strength while maintaining a low density. Replacing 10 mol% of water with 1,4-butanediol decreased the density by 26%, while increasing the specific strength by 5%. By combining glycerol and water blowing, the resulting foams exhibited a 30% lower apparent density than their water-blown analogs. The results further showed that Cn > 4 alkane chain diols had an odd–even effect on the apparent density and cell wall thickness. All foamable compositions had viscosities of approximately 7000 cSt and curing times below 2 min, allowing for quick dispensing and sufficient time for the foam to cure in semi-industrial volumes."

Stronger agricultural intensification at the field level (agrochemicals use, ploughing frequency) favors the assembly of shorter-lived communities and bird species with smaller relative brain sizes.

Agricultural intensification reduces the taxonomic diversity of bird communities, but its influence on functional diversity has been less studied. Here, we analyze the response of functional diversity of different cereal farmland bird communities across Europe to a gradient of agricultural intensification. We collected bibliographical information on life history traits (i.e. body mass, brain size, age of sexual maturity, clutch size, number of clutches, lifespan) of 30 species of birds recorded during field surveys in eight European countries. The index ""brood value"" was calculated to know each species’ level of reproductive investment per clutch. Intensification gradients at two spatial scales were obtained from field data through PCA, related to management practices at the field scale and the variation in structure and composition of farmland at the landscape scale respectively. We calculated the functional diversity index (FD) and the community-weighted mean (CWM) for each trait and sampling area, and linear mixed models in relation to the two intensification gradients were performed. Results showed that stronger intensification at the field level favors the assembly of shorter-lived communities and bird species with smaller relative brain sizes, also decreasing overall trait diversity. It also restricts the range of strategies for parental investment, reducing the functional diversity of the brood value index. More intensive field management would favor bird communities dominated by generalist and even introduced and/or managed hunting species, while putting at risk those farmland- and grassland-adapted species, typically more associated with the provision of ecosystem services. This highlights the relevance of field management (agrochemicals use, ploughing frequency) for the functional composition of bird communities and the conservation of farmland biodiversity. These findings add to existing knowledge on how species’ pace of life and cognitive capacity interact with drivers of global change, such as agricultural intensification."

We showed that the groups in our sample can be divided into two main classes: 
high-luminosity rich groups and clusters, and low-luminosity poor groups.
In rich clusters BGGs  are red and quenched galaxies, 
while in poor groups only 40- 60$% of BGGs are red and quenched, 
and the rest of the BGGs are star-forming, either blue or red. 
Rich groups and clusters are located in global high-density regions in filaments,

Our results suggest that group and cluster properties are modulated by 
their location in the cosmic web, but the properties of their BGGs are mostly

By studying the representation of the humour practices of this important minority community we can get a more complete picture of humour in Estonia. Analysis of survey results reveals that according to Russian-speakers, among their favourite topics were everyday life, sex- and family-related matters. Visual humour was the most popular form. Respondents mentioned social media as the primary way of sharing humour, but oral transmission remained important as well. The language of the shared humour was primarily Russian, and the content was mainly not specific to the Estonian cultural context. As humorous vernacular expression offers insights into the mechanisms of identity-building and integration, the choice of language and of source can be interpreted as a way to create and maintain a local identity. On the whole, Russian-speakers in Estonia are reluctant to discuss their minority status in a humorous manner."
2023,Margit Kõiv-Vainik (Author),Impact of de-icing salt runoff in spring on bioretention efficiency,,,"We investigated the effect of de-icing salt in stormwater runoff on bioretention system hydrology and filtration of contaminants. Salt runoffs during the snow melt period were simulated in 20 mesocosms planted with 1 of 3 plant species (Cornus sericea, Juncus effusus and Iris versicolor) or left unplanted, and then watered with semi-synthetic stormwater runoffs supplemented with 4 NaCl concentrations (0, 250, 1,000 or 4,000 mg Cl/L). All bioretention mesocosms, irrespective of treatment, were efficient in reducing water volume, flow and pollution level. There was no phytotoxic effect of NaCl on plants, even at the highest NaCl concentration tested. Water volume reduction and flow rate were influenced by plant species, but salt concentration had no effect. Salt runoffs significantly increased the removal of some metals, such as Cr, Ni, Pb and Zn, but had no effect on nutrient removal. Because snowmelt laden with de-icing salt is of short duration and occurs during plant dormancy, plants in bioretention may be less affected by de-icing salt than previously thought, provided that salinity decreases rapidly to normal level in the soil water. The long-term effects of de-icing salt and general performance of bioretention should be further studied under full-scale conditions."

We investigate the genetic history of the Y chromosome haplogroup L1-M22, which, while prevalent in these regions, lacks in-depth study. Robust Bayesian analyses of 165 high-coverage Y chromosomes favor a West Asian origin for L1-M22 ∼20.6 thousand years ago (kya). Moreover, this haplogroup parallels the genome-wide genetic ancestry of hunter-gatherers from the Iranian Plateau and the Caucasus. We characterized two L1-M22 harboring population groups during the Early Holocene. One expanded with the West Asian Neolithic transition. The other moved to South Asia ∼8-6 kya but showed no expansion. This group likely participated in the spread of Dravidian languages. These South Asian L1-M22 lineages expanded ∼4-3 kya, coinciding with the Steppe ancestry introduction. Our findings advance the current understanding of Eurasian historical dynamics, emphasizing L1-M22’s West Asian origin, associated population movements, and possible linguistic impacts."

Ideas take shape through the activation of previous knowledge and, when permitted, also its synthesis with information from sources that help to complement it and resolve doubts and shortcomings arising during writing. The possibility to use external help can be especially useful to those writing in a foreign language, and questions about the nature of the sources consulted can contribute new insights into language processing in the multilingual mind, as well as expand our notion of fluency. While leaving the target text is often considered a distraction, a ‘breakdown’ in fluency, it is, in fact, a part of language processing and text creation.

      This article proposes a novel way to use keylogging data from Inputlog (Leijten and Van Waes 2013) to visualise the crosslinguistic nature of solving language and content problems in L3+ writing: creating process graphs to display the temporal dynamics of different types of sources used. The example data comes from a university-level course on Spanish linguistics, where Spanish was a third or subsequent language for the participants. Evidently, the vast majority of their external activity was language-related and brief, and, interestingly, a great part of it recurs to a lingua franca, English. Some social context and reasoning is offered to explain such an observation."
